- Good morning! Today's a great day to test out the mobile interface! :)

    - Ever moving their stuff using these icons. But I might.  Be wrong. The thing is that the menu bar thing doesn't scroll properly, which makes everything clunky.
    - Some low hanging fruits would be, to replace drawing with TODOs and add one more icon in there, probably for [[Bidirectional linking]]
