    - ### **Can I change my profile picture?**
        - Unfortunately no you can't yet change your profile picture.
    - ### **Can I change my account email?**
        - Not yet but soon!  
            - Unfortunately it's not yet possible to change your email address. 
            - Our advice is to wait if it's not urgent- but if it is, there are also a few workarounds. 
            - Sign up to Roam with a new account with your preferred email - and then a few options - 
        - You can add your new email as an editor in your current graph
            - go to the three-dot-menu on the top right
            - select sharing menu
            - add your other email as an editor and hit enter
        - That way your new account will be able to access your old account (but won't have full account owner permissions).
        - Or alternatively, you could set up a new account with your new email, export your entire graph from your current account, and then import it into the new one.  
        - [[Export]] and [import]([[Import]]) features are also found under the three-dot-menu within the graph in the top right.  
    - ### **How do I sign up?**

    - ### **If I upgrade/cancel/pause my subscription, will I lose my data?**

- # [Features]([[Features]])
    - ### **How do I create a graph?**
        - Awesome! Thanks for signing up to Roam.
        - The first page you will see is the graph overview page. A graph is another name for a database. Inside a graph is where you will do all the work in Roam, writing, making blocks and pages.  And to get there, you have to create your first graph.
        - **Create your first Graph**
        - Click the + Create Graph button show below.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64002584139/original/qSyN3z64CH9l-HKnazKUR0yb7iK0xF5s6w.png?1600055258)
        - You will then be prompted to choose a graph name in the pop up.
        - Just a warning! It's currently not possible to change your graph name after it has been created. Renaming graphs will be a feature in the future, but for now, please name your Graph something you will be happy with for a while.  If you are unsure, something generic related to your name is a safe strategy.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64002584366/original/bOFXj-EzxAbc-2JWUpl2urDVgOyzW_2C6A.png?1600056262)
        - Once you have entered a New Graph Name and pressed Create Graph you will be taken to the daily notes page within your graph.  Congrats you are now officially able to use Roam!
        - You can also contact support any time via the help menu that automatically pops up when you sign up, or from the ? button in the top right of your screen.
        - But the best way to find out what Roam can do is to try for yourself and keep on Roaming!
    - ### **What's the difference between hosted vs** [[Local Graph]]?
        - There is a big difference between hosted vs local graphs.
        - You can only access the local graphs on the computer you hosted the local graphs with, whereas you can access the hosted graphs on any computer with your Roam account, as well as [[Sharing]] with collaborators for them to view or edit your graph.
        - Though, some people would prefer local graphs for ultra-security (since the notes you jot down won't hit our server) and control of data.
        - However, hosted graphs are used when we want to access our notes anywhere, on any machine, and collaborate with anyone :)
    - ### **How do I make a** [[Kanban]]**?**
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp-documentation%2FSmU5tn9gdD.gif?alt=media&token=ea2d0bbb-8ef4-4359-a0de-b06f6cca74e3)
    - ### **How do I hide private things in my database?**
        - If you need to make some blocks private, you can use our [[Encrypted Block]] feature. 
    - ### **Can I change my graph name?**
        - You can't change the name of graphs just yet. As a work around for now, you can create a new graph with your preferred name, export your notes from your old graph, and import them to your new graph. Follow these steps:
            - 1) [[Export]] your graph (click the top right '...' menu and then 'Export All' as EDN format)
            - 2) Create a new graph with the name you want (click your graph name in the top left and then 'Graphs and Settings' from the dropdown)
            - 3) Once you are in your new graph, you can import your old graph (click the top right '...' menu and then 'Graph Settings') and then restore this graph, and upload your EDN file. This has then created an identical copy of your graph, with your new name.
    - ### **Does Roam have a mobile app? Can I install it on my machine?**
        - Not yet, however Roam is available now as a webapp which gives you full access to your Roam and functions in a similar way to an app available through the appstore.
        - Here's how to install Roam as a webapp on your **phone** or **tablet**:
            - Go to chrome (or the other browser you use such as safari, firefox etc), then go to [http://www.roamresearch.com](http://www.roamresearch.com/), and it will ask you to sign in to your Roam account.
            - Once you sign in you will see this screen below. And then click the prompt at the bottom that says 'Add Roam to homescreen', which will install Roam as a link on your tablet/phone.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam%2FALLP4qNh6G.png?alt=media&token=83f0d3f8-9d42-4016-b83b-4c29816cb2a1)
            - An alternative way to do this, if you go to [roamresearch.com](http://roamresearch.com/) and sign in, you should should see 'install full site' as a button on the top right of page, if you click this it will install Roam on your device.
        - Here's how to install Roam as a webapp on your **desktop**: 
            - Go to Chrome, and open your Roam graph
            - From Chrome's three-dot-menu, go to "More Tools", "Create Shortcut"
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp-documentation%2Fq2dKP-MzXc.gif?alt=media&token=801dbe63-be9d-4d89-84cf-0c2ab85e3066)

    - ### **What are the available formats for** [exporting]([[Export]]) **and backing up the data in my graph?**
        - Markdown, JSON and EDN
    - ### **How do I create new pages?**
        - Create pages by typing square brackets [[ ]]
            - When you type two opening square brackets, `[[`, anywhere in your existing Roam pages, Roam will automatically complete with the closing square brackets. Then to create a page: all you have to do to is write the title of the page within those brackets. Hit enter and the title will turn blue indicating it has now become its own page!
            - Here's an example, where I created a new page called 'Swimming' to log my swimming sessions. Without leaving the Daily Notes, I created the [[swimming]] page, which I can then move into and back from (bidirectional linking!). I then also created a TODO for myself to look up more info for the local pool.
            - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001692551/original/g5758e4FHcVbTd89Q-w-0oVMMgXIKC5evw.gif?1597201511)
            - Creating new pages by typing square brackets in the flow of your writing takes some getting used to, but it is one of the distinctive features of Roam. Compared to other note-taking software which relies on the traditional sequence: __file -> new->  dropdown __or __file tree menu systems__, with Roam you'll expend no energy on file management. Pages - and insights! - will come about seamlessly, in the flow.
            - If you have text that you have already written, it's also possible to highlight a word or phrase, and with it highlighted  pressing [[ ]] will also turn it into a page.  Here's an example:
            - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001727031/original/9OnMLRXvfCMrxuvD_PNi25B30OaGdtR1dQ.gif?1597301248)
        - Create new pages via the search bar on the top right
            - You can use the search bar in the top right of Roam to search your existing pages, and you can also use it to create new pages.  Click on the search bar (or hit cmd+u) and your existing pages will start showing up as you type.  If you want to create a new page, type the title here, press enter, and the new page will be created.
            - Here, I use the search bar to create a page for cycling.
            - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001692577/original/0y6K-ICnL9oovOw93wZygJVWE7Va_qVg_w.gif?1597201598)
            - In terms of end result, there is no difference between the pages created with either method - [[swimming]] or [[Cycling]] both will be new pages in your database. However, the first method creates pages in the flow of writing, more spontaneously, while the second is used more consciously to create a page that you may have in mind.
    - ### **How can I add frequently used pages as a shortcut?**
        - To create a page shortcut, within the page you want to create a shortcut to, click the star button located in the top right next to the search bar.
        - Clicking this star button will add a shortcut to that page in the left sidebar menu, making the page one click away from wherever you are in Roam.
        - If later you want to remove this shortcut, follow the same process. Enter the page you want to remove from your shortcuts, and then simply un click the same star button.
        - Here's an example:
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001914617/original/K7u-pY8d8JESJwqjb_UCIyBY-gLJdW9uTA.gif?1597880957)

        - ![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/295732754/ff8f074bb3b727dee7b2aea4/2021-02-04+11.59.25.gif)
    - ### **How can I merge pages?**
        - Sometimes you can run into a situation where you've got a bunch of pages with names like: `ebooks`, `EBooks`, `eBooks`, and `Ebooks`.
        - Each of those pages may contain different data, but all of those pages refer to the same concept... ebooks. Annoying, right?
        - Well, there's actually a solution for tidying up all of these pages.
        - Let's try to merge together ebooks and EBooks into just "ebooks"
            1. Go to the EBooks page
            2. Click on the title to rename it
            3. Rename the page to ebooks
            4. An orange warning will ask you if you want to merge the two pages, click on the tick icon
            5. Done! Now all the data is merged :)

    - ### **What are namespaces?**
        - Namespaces is a function that allows you to deal with situations such as homonyms - multiple words that are spelt the same, but mean different things. You can show up to three levels with a slash `/` in the title.
        - If you want to change what is displayed, go to the three-dot-menu on top right in the graph, then click on User Settings. Under "Cycle namespace view" Choosing the top option will show the complete name, which includes all the `/` in the title

    - ### **What can I upload on Roam?**
        - You can upload and embed files in Roam, including audio, PDFs, and images, so you can access files right on the spot  
        - More here: [[Upload Files]]
    - ### **What formats does Roam support when uploading images?**
        - Currently supported formats include jpg and png.
    - ### **Why are some of my** [[Daily Notes]] **missing?**
        - Sometimes, if you're looking for a specific date, you may notice that the Daily Note for the page doesn't exist.
        - Here, notes for September 20th-22nd are missing.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64002863684/original/8S-OTfnsy_Y8nlk_gN0FikwAZvp0jf_Rsg.png?1600971627)
        - Something to know about Daily Notes is that although they are automatically created each day, they **only save when you use them.**
        - A Daily Note will save in one of two cases:
        - 1. You write on the page.
        - 2. You linked to the Daily Note from a different page.
        - You can see this from the All Notes view (from the left sidebar). In the picture below, pages for September 17th and 19th were created but have no content.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64002864033/original/KhotePm9AM16UV7slmUCsMyt5zb02rEKBA.png?1600972704)
        - Both dates have one mention, though. You can see from the Linked References of the page that the Daily Note of September 17th was linked from the previous day.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64002864002/original/XWgVHyBnm1SKeCaLNI0RdVxLybH27SeBuQ.png?1600972634)
        - If you can't find a specific date in your Roam graph, it is most likely because you didn't use Roam on that day or you did all your writing in separate pages.
        - If you're sure that you took notes on a specific Daily Note and can't find it, please reach out to us at support@roamresearch.com
    - ### **How do I** [export]([[Export]]) **a page from Roam?**
        - First navigate to the page you want to export and then press **Export** inside the **... Share menu **in the top right of your screen:
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001263310/original/g1W7uQMutrhZins74VE4jkaMOjsIg2kXUg.png?1595898413)
        - Next you can choose between Markdown and JSON formats for the page you want to export. We recommend exporting into JSON if you want to import the page into another Roam graph as it keeps more Roam-specific information than Markdown allows for.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001263339/original/sm7A-n6J0AAzMgIogkMpXQurLtZuW9nFQA.png?1595898579)
        - Your file will download once you press the **Export button**:
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001263382/original/VtoLkm7e1HPsJxpHML5Vi7RwPuKaB7DEAA.png?1595898687)
    - ### **How do** [import]([[Import]]) **notes into Roam?**
        - We currently offer two ways to import notes into Roam: JSON and Markdown.
        - If you are interested in importing Roam notes, we suggest you import with JSON, which stores more metadata about Roam-specific content and will allow you to more seamlessly move notes from one graph to another. On the other hand, if you plan to import text files from any other source, we recommend Markdown.
        - Here's how you can import notes in Roam:
        - 1. Press **Import Files**__ __inside the **... **share menu at the top-right of your screen:
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001125852/original/qhjN0-hAwjfWDbisQuRQgZlzC7HFCDbGGA.png?1595529418)
        - 2. Now choose your Markdown or JSON files from your file system and you will see them show inside the pop up, where you can see a preview, change file names, and choose which files you want to finish importing:
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001125883/original/znjdCnp0bRxr-OhLtNV4uYkw7I8XI7JjFA.png?1595529505)
        - 3. Once they are finished uploading, you will see them available on your current Daily Notes page under the block "Import":
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001125948/original/goZwX0qJj7ZUiPjr1dtpBkcASmGbcH8iyQ.png?1595529686)
        - And there you have it! A quick and easy way to import your files into Roam.
    - ### **Can I merge two graphs?**
        - Unfortunately it's not possible to merge graphs currently. [Importing]([[Import]]) in EDN format will overwrite the previous content in your graph.
        - If one of the graphs is small, you can manually copy paste each page into another graph. Then, import all your content in EDN format into the small graph to have all your content in one place. 
        - To import in EDN format, go to the ... menu > Graph settings > Restore graphs
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp-documentation%2FSgFSQeP1DW.gif?alt=media&token=55c8c34e-1028-4442-8744-7268d4e3a002)
    - ### **If I delete a graph, can I reuse that name when creating a new one?**
        - Previous graph names are available for re-use 90 days after the deletion. So here are three possible options:
            1. ﻿Wait till then;
            2. ﻿Use another suitable name;
            3. Write in another graph meanwhile, then after 90 days, create the old-name graph again, [export]([[Export]]) all your from temporary name graph in __EDN__ format and [import]([[Import]]) it to the old-name graph.
    - ### **How to use templates and do you have some** [[Templates]] **I can use?**
        - Check out how to use templates here: [[Templates]]
        - Check out some of our template collections here: [[roam/templates]]
    - ### **How do I collapse or expand all blocks in a page?**
        - If you have nested blocks in a page, it's possible to collapse or expand all of your blocks in a page with a single click.
        - To do this, right mouse click on the title of the page. This will bring up a contextual menu that includes the options to expand or collapse all blocks.
        - ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/64001910098/original/NJ8FqnNUwLjfbrMkZK2R_SqEfBKnx37VgQ.gif?1597868449)
    - ### **Why can't I hear the** [[Pomodoro timer]] **bell sound?**
        - In order for the pomodoro bell sound to go off, the timer needs to be in a page that's currently **open** in your graph.
        - Here's an example:
            - I start a pomodoro timer, and the block is on my [[Daily Notes]] page for the day.
            - While working I open other pages
            - If at the end of the pomodoro session I haven't returned to my [[Daily Notes]] view, **I won't hear the sound**
        - The solution is fairly simple:
            - Once you decide the page where you want your pomodoro timer to live, open that same page in the [right sidebar]([[Right Sidebar]]), so that your timer will always stay in an open page.
    - ### **How to do I paste text in a single block?**
        - In order to paste content using [soft line breaks]([[Adding soft line breaks in a block]]), use `ctrl-shift-v`.

    - ### **How do I** [share]([[Sharing]]) **my graph?**
        - Roam allows to share your graph as **readable** or **editable** by everyone with the url, or with specific emails addresses.
        - You can access these settings from the three-dot-menu -> Share
        - Here's how to share your graph as **readable** by everyone with the url:
            - From "Share" settings, toggle the option "can be read by anyone with the url", then click away
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp-documentation%2Fzku2IXzUiI.gif?alt=media&token=169f61f6-e752-48a0-832f-2fbc13b84352)
        - Here's how to share your graph as **editable** by everyone with the url:
            - From "Share" settings, toggle the option "can be edited by anyone with the url", then click away

        - Here's how to share a graph with specific **readers**:
            - From "Share" settings, toggle the option "is shared only with the emails below", then add your emails under the "Readers" box in the bottom right. Hit enter and those emails will be added as readers. 
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp-documentation%2F3Y6w9oqp9k.gif?alt=media&token=1295e3f2-0936-43ff-915b-243845477fe2)

    - ### **How secure are my uploaded files?**
        - When you upload an image, audio, or PDF file, it is stored on Google Firebase servers . While the link is public, it has a random unique identifier that is impossible for someone to just guess. So any images you upload are private so long as you keep the links private. If someone obtains access to your file's link then they can access it. No one can delete any files you have uploaded. We are releasing a file manager soon so you can view all your uploaded files and delete any files you do not want stored on Google's servers.
    - ### **Are my uploaded files/images automatically indexed by Google?**
        - Absolutely not!
    - ### **Where are local graphs stored?**
        - Local graphs are stored in your browser's local storage. This means that if you clear your browser data then you will lose all the data in your local graph. To mitigate this risk, we recommend you set up daily automatic backups.
    - ### **Can I store my data on my computer?**
        - Right now, the only way to store data is in your browser's local storage. We will soon be offering a local file storage solution where you can have your Roam data stored inside your computer's file system.
    - ### **Who can access my data?**
        - By default, hosted graphs you create are accessible only to you. You can also set up read and write access for specific emails or even make your hosted graph publicly readable or editable (you cannot however share your local graph with anyone). 
            - No one on the Roam team can access your data without your written permission.
        - Local graphs are accessible to anyone who accesses Roam (even their own account) on the browser your local graph is stored currently. We are in the midst of removing this behaviour and only the user who made the local graph will have access to it.
    - ### **Can anyone access my pages / graphs?**
        - No, unless you want them to. 
            - If you set your graph to publicly readable or editable, 
                - then your entire graph will be able to be seen or edited by anyone, respectively. 
            - If you share a page with someone else, 
                - because of the current architecture of the app, when someone with the link to the page opens it, it loads the entire graph's data into the browser and if a technically adept, motivated person could hypothetically, access the rest of your graph data, IF they had the link to your graph.
                    - However, a regular user would not be able to access the rest of the contents of your graph through the UI, they would just have access to the single page you shared.
    - ### **If local graphs are private, does that mean hosted graphs are public?**
        - No-- local graphs are always private and cannot be shared. 
        - Hosted graphs are private by default, but you can choose to share them with others.
    - ### **Are my notes private?**
        - All your notes are private by default. They will only be accessible by others if you have a hosted graph AND you have explicitly shared with other users explicitly from the Settings panel.
    - ### **Are local graphs secure enough for corporate IT policies?**
        - Local graphs are not ever stored anywhere except your computer, but they are not encrypted so whether they are secure __enough__ depends on your corporate IT policy.
    - ### **Is my data secure?**
        - Hosted graph data is stored in Google Firebase and inherits their security, the data is encrypted at rest inside Google's servers.
        - Local graph data is as secure as your computer is.
    - ### **Do you offer end-to-end encryption?**
        - We do not offer end-to-end encryption currently but it is something we are considering.
    - ### **Do you offer 2-factor authentication?**
        - We do not offer 2-factor authentication currently but it is something we are considering.

    - ### **What's your security standards and** [[Privacy Policy]]**?**
        - Roam's data is hosted by Google, encrypted at rest, and encrypted over the wires.
        - ﻿We follow industry best practices for encryption - same as Evernote and Notion - but we make an additional guarantee in our [[Privacy Policy]] to not ever read your notes without your permission.
        - If you want more thorough encryption, you can use the [[Encrypted Block]]. For more details on how we treat our users data, you can see our [[Privacy Policy]].
