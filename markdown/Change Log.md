        - [[Roam Depot Extensions]]
            - ## [Semantic Scholar](https://github.com/mlava/semantic-scholar)
                - Access the scientific literature right within your Roam Research graph.
                - This extension allows you to get data from the 214 Million Papers, 2.49 Billion Citations and 79 Million Authors in the Semantic Scholar database.
                - There are a number of ways to access the data:
                    - Article title search
                    - Article Id search
                    - Author name search
                    - Author Id search
                    - Recommended articles using one article as the prompt
                    - Relevant articles for a search term
                - All six options can have Roam Research hotkeys enabled to make searching for new data as quick as a keystroke!
                - **Notes:**
                    - Please note that Semantic Scholar offers an API key by application, however this extension DOES NOT need an API key to work. Without an API key, Semantic Scholar limits calls to their API, and you might receive an error message that you are trying to import data too often. I have implemented a retry mechanism that will attempt up to ten times at ten second intervals, and will provide feedback about what is happening.
                    - You can apply for an API key at https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key. If you are approved, you can enter the token in the Roam Depot settings for this extension, under the 'Set Here' or 'Home' tab.
                    - I successfully applied for an API key by stating that I was accessing the data for personal usage and would not be downloading any individual articles/papers in bulk, but one at a time.
                    - Rest assured that unless Semantic Scholar changes their access provisions, this extension will work without an API key. It might just be a bit slower, and give you warnings from time-to-time.
                - To import a specific article, you can use IDs from Semantic Scholar (Corpus Id or Paper Id), DOI, Association for Computational Linguistics ID (ACL), arXiv ID, Microsoft Academic Graph ID (MAG), PubMed ID or PubMed Central ID. You can control which data is retrieved for an individual article by setting your preferences in the Roam Depot settings in the Article tab.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FUAske22vHg.png?alt=media&token=6ad48487-ffbc-4672-be54-686d685b89e8)
                - You can decide what data you want to see for an article, and the order in which it is output. These options include Journal data, Article Type, Authors, References, Citations, Influential Citations, External Sources and Abstract.
                - If an article is Open Access and/or has an Open Access PDF, links to these sources will be displayed with the Article metadata.
                - Author metadata can be imported using the Semantic Scholar Author ID. Again, the data types you wish to retrieve for an author can be set in the Author tab in the Roam Depot settings.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FDuUdBz8kaa.png?alt=media&token=97c7fb5c-2319-469f-bb57-7894d9b5cce1)
                - You can also decide what data you want to see for an author, and the order in which it is output. These options include Affiliations, Home Page, Citation Count, h-Index and Publications.
                - You can choose to hide certain types of data from Article or Author import, and this will prevent that data being called from the Semantic Scholar API. This will reduce data transfer.
                - You can search for a paper by title, and Semantic Scholar will only return a single result. Of course, you can filter the search to limit to particular Fields of Study, years of publication, venue of publication, minimum citation count, Open Access status and the availability of an Open Access PDF.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FrtcySieB8n.png?alt=media&token=ca41b36a-63ef-4d0f-8232-747690925e6a)
                - Or, search for an author by name and Semantic Scholar will return a list of authors. You can define how many you want to retrieve in the Author tab in settings.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FCojEFm7Lrd.png?alt=media&token=d270bd83-427f-47f0-8589-28bc13358394)
                - Semantic Scholar uses a machine learning algorithm to determine relationships between articles, and you can access this feature in two ways. The first is to search for articles using the Relevance Search feature. You can enter a search term and a variety of filters to find the most accurate results.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2Fahehr8z8In.png?alt=media&token=cd50dbd9-26bf-4dbc-9a60-d3b46a41c83e)
                - Or, search for recommended articles related to a specific article using the article Paper Id from Semantic Scholar.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2Ffd34_MhZl2.png?alt=media&token=88b610c2-6620-4276-9c48-28b8767c2ed2)
                - You can define how many results to obtain for Recommended or Relevance searches in the appropriate tab in Roam Depot settings.
                - Semantic Scholar classifies their data using the following Fields of Study:
                    - Computer Science
                    - Medicine
                    - Chemistry
                    - Biology
                    - Materials Science
                    - Physics
                    - Geology
                    - Psychology
                    - Art
                    - History
                    - Geography
                    - Sociology
                    - Business
                    - Political Science
                    - Economics
                    - Philosophy
                    - Mathematics
                    - Engineering
                    - Environmental Science
                    - Agricultural and Food Sciences
                    - Education
                    - Law
                    - Linguistics
                - You can set your preferred Fields of Study in the Roam Depot settings for this extension as comma-separated list. e.g. Medicine,Biology,Business
                - The best features are enabled if you also have the SmartBlocks extension installed. When you install this extension, a new page will be created in your graph entitled 'Semantic Scholar Configuration'. This has all of the required SmartBlocks so that you won't need to create anything yourself.
                - When you import any data from Semantic Scholar, a SmartBlock button will be placed after all article titles, author names, and search results. You can click that SmartBlock button to import the data for that item to your graph as well. For lists of Recommended or Relevant Article searches, or Author Name searches, you will be presented with both Refresh and Import More SmartBlock buttons. If you import 5 authors, for example, the Import More button will import another five authors. Refresh will update the data if there has been new publications become available.

        - [[Roam Depot Extensions]]
            - ## [Automatic DNP](https://github.com/mlava/auto-DNP)
                - Roam CRM turns your graph into a __Relationship Management__ tool. Inspired by [Sivers](https://sive.rs/hundreds), and David Rockefeller's collection of [200,000 index cards](https://archive.is/zxbCA), Roam CRM keeps people and dates important to you top of mind.
                - ## Usage Example
                    - **NOTE**
                    - There are certain tags and templates that Roam CRM relies on; **Tags:: #people** and **#Agenda** are the most vital. While these are not currently customizable they may be in the future.
                - ## Setup
                    - Roam CRM is built on top of several Roam extensions. Please install them on Roam Depot:
                        - [Google](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-google) by David Vargas
                            - Install Google extension from Roam Depot
                            - Add your google accounts and calendar by following that extension's README
                            - You can now automatically pull events into Daily Note
                        - [Workbench](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-workbench) by David Vargas
                            - Install Workbench extension and enable the Attribute Select feature
                            - Navigate to the newly created page in your graph [[roam/js/attribute-select]]
                            - Add the attribute Contact Frequency
                            - Add these five options
                                - #[[A List]]: Contact every two weeks
                                - #[[B List]]: Contact every two months
                                - #[[C List]]: Contact every six months
                                - #[[D List]]: Contact once a year
                                - #[[F List]]: Never contact
                            - This is for convenience when switching a person's contact frequency. These durations are customizable in the Roam CRM settings.
                        - [Query Builder](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-query-builder) by David Vargas
                            - Install Query Builder extension
                            - Import Call Rollup Queries from
                - ## Features
                    - ### Metadata
                        - Roam CRM creates metadata for each Tags::#people page inspired by [Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ti_xaV9IVvj-bklxOjNY-IeGsC-YqcgvB03qvfFQrnI/). This metadata and its structure is important, **without this structure Roam CRM will not work.**
                        - Each person page must have metadata structure which looks like this. You can use the **Person Metadata Template** button in the Roam CRM settings to import a quick Roam template for this metadata structure ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/metadata.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/metadata.png)
                        - At the bare minimum a person page must have this metadata for it to be recoginzed by Roam CRM ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/metadataMinimum.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/metadataMinimum.png)
                    - ### Agenda Addr
                        - Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about or responding to one-off issues in real time. A much more efficient method is to batch your issues and discuss them all at once.
                            - Make a block anywhere that has as persons name ([[Bill Gates]] for example) and a hashtag #Agenda
                            - Roam CRM will automatically nest a block ref on Bill's page under an agenda attribute
                            - Use a hashtag to have the extension hide the name in the Agenda, e.g. #[[Bill Gates]]
                            - Next time you talk, you'll remember everything you wanted to tell Bill
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/agendaAddr.gif)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/agendaAddr.gif)
                    - ### Contact Reminders
                        - Set contact frequency reminders for each person. This can be customized in the settings. A modal will pop up reminding you to contact them.
                            - #[[A List]]: Contact every two weeks
                            - #[[B List]]: Contact every two months
                            - #[[C List]]: Contact every six months
                            - #[[D List]]: Contact once a year
                            - #[[F List]]: Never contact
                        - Within the modal you can type a quick message to each person to stay in flow. This message will be nested on their page for future reference.
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/modal%20message.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/modal%20message.png)
                    - ### Birthday Reminders
                        - Birthday reminders happen 14 days before, and on the day of. They remind you that 'Bill Gates turned 46 today.' A and B listers birthday reminders show up in the modal 14 & 7 days before as well as on the day of.
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/modal%20birthdays.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/modal%20birthdays.png)
                        - C and B lister birthdays only show up on the day-of as a block ref on the DNP
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/birthdayRef.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/birthdayRef.png)
                        - D and F listers do now show up at all
                    - ### Full Page CRM UI
                        - Easially accessable through the (optional) left sidebar button or via the modal toolbar the CRM Workspace is the central hub for all your contacts and your timeline of events.
                            - People
                                - A sortable list of all contacts together in one place
                            - Events
                                - Birthdays, calls, meetings, and any mentions are all shown in chronological order (sorted by either the DNP they show up on or the block's creation date)
                            - Home
                                - Coming soon, this will be a homepage for quick access to all CRM functionality. If you have ideas or wants for this space do reach out!
                        - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/workplace.gif)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/workplace.gif)
                    - ### Google Calendar Sync
                        - Via the Google extension RoamCRM, has the ability (toggable in settings) to connect to a google calendar and sync upcoming events to your graph. When enabled events in the next 7 days with more than 1 guest/attendee will be synced to your graph on the Daily Notes Page coresponding with the event date. If the event attendees, date, or details change Roam CRM will update the graph block accordingly.
                        - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/event.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-Roam-CRM/raw/main/images/event.png)
                    - ### Hotkeys
                        - Roam CRM adds quality of life hotkeys for a variety of tasks including:
                            - Interacting with the right sidebar
                            - Showing the Reminder Modal as well as the Full Page CRM Workplace
                        - All hotkeys are configurable in settings
            - ## [Sheet Music](https://github.com/mlava/sheet-music)
                - For music lovers, sheet music in Roam Research is finally available!
                - Create your own music using [abc notation](https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard) or paste and render sheet music for music you find on the internet.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FcYbkazDa8-.png?alt=media&token=27a878ba-3f8c-401f-9721-cbcc0fe2a283)
                - There are two options available at present:
                    - Paste music in the abc notation directly into your graph using the command palette option 'Paste sheet music in ABC notation'
                    - Create music in abc notation within your graph. Start with a blank template by using the command palette option 'Create sheet music in ABC notation'
                - You can find examples of music in abc notation at:
                    - https://abcnotation.com/examples
                    - https://thesession.org/
                    - https://www.montrealsession.ca/index.html
                - Standard abc notation applies - you can find a key to the notation at [abc notation](https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard).
                - **Notes:**
                    - In this first iteration, only one piece of music can be rendered on a page. I am working on a fix to allow multiple pieces to render correctly.
                    - At present, dragging notes in the rendered music will change the child block in RR but not the textarea box. I am working on a fix. In the meantime, you can click the pencil icon at top right to re-render the music and the changes you've made will be picked up.
    - [[July 25th, 2024]]
        - Fixed issue with [[Graph Overview]] explore mode where if a page was selected but then deleted it would cause an infinite loading spinner
    - [[July 24th, 2024]]
        - Update password requirements to be more secure
        - Force all users to reset their passwords (sign in with google/apple not affected)
            - Reasoning::
                - Over the past two weeks we have been working to defend against a DDOS/credential stuffing attack. Credential stuffing is where the attackers have a list of emails and possible passwords (from the dark web) and they attempt to log in to Roam with each one. For those who are technical, you can read [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/google-firebase-authentication-vulnerability-245050cb7ceb) that explains the vulnerability of our auth provider in more depth.
                - This has been a very sophisticated attack, we think they have access to millions of different computers (they rotate IP addresses very quickly) and millions of email addresses they are attempting to log into. For awhile we had managed to slow them down and stop them, but they adapted and resumed the attack.
                - The attackers have unfortunately gained access to some accounts this way.
                - I want to be clear that Roam did not leak these emails and passwords, we never directly have access to your password, we use Google/Firebase to manage them. Most accounts are unaffected and the attackers are mostly trying emails which don’t have accounts with Roam. The only way a Roam account could be affected by this attack is IF you had reused your Roam password somewhere else AND that service leaked your password. This attack also **does not affect those who use google or apple sign in only**, and it does not affect encrypted graphs, unless the encrypted graph password was used in another service and leaked there.
                - I recommend everyone visits https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see if your email/password has been involved in a data breach. It’s likely that if it has, then this attacker has tried to sign into Roam with it.We are still working with our authentication provider’s support (Google) to see if there is something we can do to stop attacks like this, but it increasingly looks like there is not.
                - We are taking this very seriously and trying to do everything we can to protect the security of your Roam accounts. Therefore, we have decided to **change our password requirements to be more secure, and force all users to reset their passwords**. As soon as you sign out, you will not be able to sign back in until you reset your password. Eventually we will force everyone to sign out as well. We may also build more security features like multi-factor authentication in the future.
                - When setting a new password, we highly recommend using a unique one you have not used anywhere else. This is because, at the end of the day, if someone has your email and password, there is not that much we can do.
                - If you have any difficulty resetting your password, please email [support@roamresearch.com](mailto:support@roamresearch.com). I am very sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused.

            1. ### Alt-click (or opt-click) on a daily note page link to change the date
                - If you're a fellow procrastinator, you can use this to snooze any tasks for a future date! 😅

                    - When you find old/overdue tasks, assign them to today so you do not forget about them
                - Btw, the “Coming Monday” in the date shortcuts gets set to “Coming Sunday” or other day of the week depending upon the “First day of the week” setting in Settings > User > International

            - ### The New [[Roam Append API]] is out now!
                - This allows you to capture stuff to your unencrypted & **encrypted** graphs!
                - **If you’re not a dev**, 
                    - just know that this opens up a lot of possibilities for capture to your roam graphs.
                        - The [recent improved Speak to Roam apple shortcut](((l-E_9lmp_))) uses this, for example. 
                        - We also have a couple more use-cases/integrations which will be dropping soon!
                            - In particular, a Zapier Integration, which would allow you to do things like:
                                - Automatically save Google Form/typeform responses to a page in your graph
                                - Add Slack saved messages to your graph

        - ### Improved [Speak to Roam Apple Shortcut]([[Apple Shortcuts/Speak to Roam]]) with support for encrypted graphs, capture to daily note, and more!! ✨✨
            - Link to install the newest version **v1.3.0**: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ae1ae833cada4999b44d9ac5dda2dc6d
                - Please checkout the [[Getting started]] guide to get started
            - **Improvements**
                1. We now support both encrypted graphs and unencrypted graphs
                    - On encrypted graphs, you can create an "append-only" token!
                2. Captures to today's Daily Notes Page by default
                    - Captures are stored under a block/capture group `[[Speak to Roam]] Captures`
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FHju0azD0Rk.png?alt=media&token=0aeb4cfa-8d59-45d0-bc34-e498769a94b1)
                    - If you do not want to capture to DNP, you can alternatively pass an input page to capture underneath!
                3. More resilient to shortcut failure (If shortcut fails, you can find the recordings in Files in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/FailedRecordings`. If it suceeds, you can find them in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/HandledRecordings`. Behavior slightly different on Apple Watch)
                4. Shortcut is now available on the Share Sheet without extra configuration
                    - You can use this to share recordings from the Voice Memos app to Roam via the shortcut!
            - **Requirements**
                - apple devices only (iphone, ipad, mac, apple watch, etc.)
                - Need an OpenAI API key for transcription & optional post-processing.

            - Renamed "quick search" to "Find or create page search" to match what it was called elsewhere
            - Added all of the commands/hotkeys you can use "everywhere" (see the hotkeys settings), such as toggling the sidebars, moving back / forward a day, or toggling brackets.
            - In addition to these we added more commands for

                - Open graph overview
                - Open today's daily note in sidebar

            - # [Live AI Assistant (former Speech-to-Roam)](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-speech-to-roam)
                - Speak instead of having to type into Roam. 
Additionally, you can speak to a GPT model (providing context to the model from your Roam graph by selecting blocks before calling the command!), or even do translations to English
                - ## Features
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FxtLDz8oskA.png?alt=media&token=7d96b57a-b6dd-45b9-9c3e-da784e4c5a31)
                        - By default, the controls will be inserted in the left sidebar, after "Daily Notes". It's possible to display them in the topbar (always visible, more convenient on mobile).
                    - ### Voice transcription
                        - the transcribed text will be inserted at the bottom of the current page (or page view) or appended to the current focused block.
                        - Uses either an OpenAI API Key (that you need to set up in the extension settings), or if you disable Whisper, uses the free Web Speech API (⚠️ not available in Electron Desktop app and Firefox or Arc browser)
                    - ### Translation
                        - A large number of [source languages are supported](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/supported-languages), but the target language is currently limited to English. This limitation can be easily overcome through post-processing using a GPT model, as it only requires asking it to translate into any language.
                    - ### Speak directly to an AI Assistant (OpenAI GPT models)
                        - ask any question, rephrasing, completion, translation! Feel free to specify the expected format of the response (its length, style, etc.).
                        - assistant response is inserted as last child of prompt block (current limitation: the answer is only one long block)
                        - you can easily **provide context by selecting some block(s)** in the page or right sidebar. You can use it to extend a conversation, ask a question about any content, request a summary or translation, and so on. 🚀
                        - on mobile (selection being not possible), place the cursor in a block to use its content as context, or enable the option to use the whole current view as context (unless you place the cursor in a blank block).
                        - model by default is currently gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
                            - you can try other chat completion model, or your own fine-tuned models
                - ## Quick Start
                    - Install the extension by searching for "Speech to Roam" in Roam Depot
                    - Then, right after installation,
                        - In the settings, provide an OpenAI API key (by copying/pasting an existing key or generating a new key via [this link](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)). You need an account on OpenAI to benefit from Whisper transcriptions.
                - ⚠️ __Currently, this extension doesn't work on either the MacOS desktop app or the Android app, but it works on browsers (desktop and mobile) and on Windows desktop app.__

        - [[Roam Depot Extensions]]
            - # [Nautilus](https://github.com/tombarys/roam-depot-nautilus)
                - Nautilus is a Roam Research extension with a unique approach to stress-free day planning and time blocking in Roam
                - This visual approach reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed, enhances task-effort estimating skills, and clearly shows what the feasible tasks are for the rest of the day. The spiral shape mirrors one's diminishing energy for creative tasks over a given day.
                - ## Features
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FW6-cphnZ2t.png?alt=media&token=f8b434e1-653b-455a-8971-4020ed0781b6)
                - ## Usage
                    - only once: install **Nautilus** and **TODO Trigger** extension
                    - insert the component at the top of your Daily Page using ;;Nautilus template
                    - indent all events and tasks that you want to accomplish below the component as its children
                    - start inserting tasks, then folow up with events
                    - use e.g. "12:30-14:20" or "9 to 10:45" to anchor fixed time events
                    - use e.g. "10m" or "20min" to set the task duration (other than default)
                    - use e.g. "d18:30" or "d9:05" in tasks to denote the time when they were finished (or use extension for it)
                    - during a day: reorder tasks and move some of them after fixed events to ensure they will not be planned earlier

                - Getting Started Guide
                    1. Install [[Raycast]] from https://raycast.com
                    2. Then install the Roam Extension from: https://raycast.com/roamresearch/roam-research
                    3. Follow the loom video below to add a graph
                        - {{[[video]]: https://www.loom.com/share/31ada35f7c8b4f44a2ba537b15237854}}

                - Big thanks to [[hyc]] for their work on the initial version of this extension 🙏
                - P.S. Users of the older versions of the Raycast extension will need to add their graph(s) again. Sorry for the inconvenience, this should only be a one time thing
            - [[Roam Depot Extensions]]
                - # [Send To Graph](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph)
                    - A Roam Research extension to send blocks from one graph to another. The destination graph does not need to be open. This is a one-way push. The blocks are added to the new graph as if you had created them manually yourself.
                    - ## Features
                        - Send blocks to another graph with a simple right-click command or via hotkey.
                        - Configure multiple graphs to send blocks to.
                        - Option to nest sent blocks under a parent block (for example an __#inbox__ tag) in the destination graph.
                    - ## Setup
                        - This extension uses the new Roam backend API to allow sending of blocks to graphs that you do not have open. Note: only the creator of a graph can create new API tokens.
                            - In your destination graph go to the Graph Settings page and select New API Token
                                - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-1.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-1.png)
                            - Name the token however you want but make sure to set the Access Scope to Edit Access. This gives the extention edit permissions to the graph.
                                - Note: When sending blocks I __ONLY__ add to the destination graph. There is no code to modify or delete __ANYTHING__.
                                - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-2.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-2.png)
                            - Select Create to generate your unique graph API token. Make sure to save the generated token before navigating away as it is not possible to see the token again once you have navigated away.
                            - Open up the Source Graph and navigate to the Send To Graph settings page.
                            - Add the Graph name and Edit Access token for the destination graph to the settings panel and hit the plus symbol. If either of these is incorrect in any way blocks you attempt to send will not go through. You can add as many graphs as you like.
                                - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-3.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-3.png)
                    - ## Usage
                        - There are 2 ways of using the Send-To-Graph extension:
                            - Right-click on a block and select "Send to Graph". If you have multiple graphs configured, you will be asked to select the destination graph.
                            - Alternatively, assign a hotkey via the settings panel to send the currently focused block to another graph.
                    - ## Example
                        - {{video: https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/assets/4028391/fee66356-1a15-4432-9b73-52ece2c4d6d9}}

                    - A simple Roam Research extension that saves the position of the scrollbar on each page, and when you return to this page, it reverts to the position you last viewed.
                    - It just saves the position of the scrollbar in the browser's memory, so when you refresh the browser, the last saved data will be cleared.

            - [[Quality of Life Improvements]]
                - Changes to `{{video}}` `{{video-timestamp}}` #[[Video Timestamps]]
                    - Video timestamps now include a block reference to the video they belong to
                        - They can be dragged anywhere in Roam, and you can see all of the timestamps of a video from the linked references
                        - Old video timestamps will still work, but they are not auto updated to include the block reference
                    - Fixed a bug where timestamps would play a video hidden in the zoom path
                    - Inserting a timestamp now automatically adds a space after the timestamp
                - Templates will now apply the state of `{{sliders}}`, `{{excalidraw}}`, `{{diagram}}` and other `{{}}` components
                    - You can also now reference templates inside themselves to track the usage of them

                - [[Performance Improvements]] and new search feature for [[Linked References]]
                    - Linked references now load lazily, which means it should open __much__ faster than before.
                    - The downside is that you can no longer search through them with `cmd-f` or `ctrl-f`, you need to use the built in search component.
                    - The new search looks through all of the references, the paths of the references, or the children if the children are open.

                        - Select the Icon Theme. [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/versions/3/#icons) is the default for Roam Research. Roam Studio provides [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).
                        - Select the first magic word - this is the name of the tag (e.g., if your tag is #love, your magic word is "love")
                        - Select an icon from the predefined list
                        - Select a color from the predefined list
                        - Select the lightness of the color
                        - **Notes** You can use the same icon for multiple tags - with different colors if you like. An example of this would be a marker for high and critical tasks, which both would use the alert icon, but in yellow for high and red for critical.

            - ### [[Quality of Life Improvements]] ✨
                - [[Performance Improvement]] to [[Filters]]
                    - Opening filters is 4-5x faster
                    - Adding or removing a filter is 15-30x faster
                    - Memory usage is a lot less
                    - This is assuming [[Linked References]] is closed, because displaying all of the references is still very slow
                        - We will be releasing an improvement to linked references to solve this problem soon
                    - Internally we completely rewrote how these work to use the same logic as queries, so that in the future we can add OR filters
                    - The counts for tags changed inside of linked refs filter
                        - The counts now represent how many of the linked references have that tag. When you filter for "includes" a tag, it will show you that many references
                - Small [[Performance Improvement]] to [[Unlinked References]]
                - Small [[Performance Improvement]] to [[Streak]]
                - [Another](((g3OZJ86Le))) small [[Performance Improvement]] to [[All Pages]]
                - Fixed bug that caused versions to be reordered
                - Fixed old daily notes loading on scroll
                    - previously it could get stuck and you would have to hover over the new note

                        - Uses 1/3 of the memory of before
                - Fixed double digit numbered lists inside of the `{{search: }}` component

                - Big [[Query]] update!
                    - Queries are 2 to 10 times faster than before, depending on what you are querying for
                    - Queries do not auto update by default now
                        - To rerun the query, click the refresh button on the top right
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FSyeBzzxFj4.png?alt=media&token=dce1c454-ea46-4e82-85a4-e0aeb6c11571)
                            - Closing and re opening the query will also rerun it
                        - We made this change so that Roam doesn't get really slow when you have a query open on the page
                        - If you liked how it worked before, you can change the default back to auto updating in user settings

                        - You can change the current block view by searching in the command palette (`cmd-p`) for "Change Block View"
                            - Then type the letter of the block view you wish to use as displayed on the screen

                    - above is an image so that it displays properly in older Roam clients. If you'd like to play with it, the excalidraw drawing itself is nested underneath this block
                        - {{[[excalidraw]]}} {{-: Text elements in drawing: updated to latest version (v0.14) ; use via slash command: "/excalidraw" ;   Some notable upgrades ; - Supports images inside of the drawings ; - Dark mode, Canvas Background ; - Ability to resize the drawings in view mode ; - Text elements within the drawing can now be searched ; - Better pen support ; - etc }}

                    - Better pen support
                    - etc
            - ### [[Quality of Life Improvements]] ✨
                - Added JSON and JSON-LD [[Code Block]] languages
                - Theme Authors and [[CSS]] hackers can now target code blocks for specific languages via new CSS classes of the format `.rm-code-block--{lang}`. For example: `.rm-code-block--js` for javascript code blocks, `.rm-code-block--clj` for Clojure code blocks #[[CSS Changes]]
                    - As an example, here are the customized CSS we're using for the new JSON and JSON-LD languages (color scheme inspired from VS Code)
                        - ```css
.rm-code-block--json, .rm-code-block--json-ld {
  // colors inspired from VS Code
  .cmt-propertyName {
    color: #22509F;
  }
  .cmt-bool {
    color: #0000ff;
  }
  .cmt-number {
    color: #458A64;
  }
  .cmt-string {
    color: #95261F
  }

}

.rm-code-block--json-ld {
  // json-ld seems to use cmt-atom for booleans and cmt-meta for property names that begin with @
  .cmt-atom {
    color: #0000ff;
  }
  .cmt-meta {
    color: #22509fb6; // a lighter version of cmt-propertyName
  }

                - ## [Quick Insert Block](https://github.com/dive2Pro/roam-quick-insert-block)
                    - When you need to insert a block above or below the target block , this plugin can help you reduce the number of steps.

                - ## [Sidebar Separators](https://github.com/mlava/sidebar-separators)
                    - Organize your left sidebar shortcuts with separators.
                    - Sometimes you just want some visual separation between your list of shortcuts. This extension allows you to add a horizontal line or blank space between any of your shortcuts, so you can achieve just that.
                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)
                    - In the above image I've inserted a horizontal line after my second shortcut and a blank line after my sixth shortcut.
                    - You can configure each separator in the Roam Depot settings. Use an integer to state where to insert the separator - it will be inserted after that numbered shortcut.
                    - You can have up to three separators, but if there's a need I'll add the option to create more.
                - ## [Roam Depot Format Hotkeys](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-format-hotkeys)
                    - Adds hotkeys for various block formatting options including:
                        - Justify Block (Left, Center, Right, Full)
                        - View As Numbered List
                - ## [Page references counter](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-ref-count)
                    - ### [🔗](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-ref-count/tree/0de3d685be89d75b62e0e99883e589ac4b62bbc8#inline-count-for-page-references-tags-and-attributes-as-superscript-like-vanilla-inline-block-reference-counter)Inline count for page references, tags and attributes as superscript (like vanilla inline block reference counter).
                        - 🔎 References counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, what is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!
                        - ![ref-count-v1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74436347/218118672-4d7e74aa-e47f-49fb-ac95-7e59e2b1b854.gif)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74436347/218118672-4d7e74aa-e47f-49fb-ac95-7e59e2b1b854.gif)
                        - By default, inline counts are always displayed. As an option, you can make the count appear only on hover over a given page reference. You can toggle separately inline count and search count with dedicated commands in command palette (with customizable hotkeys).

                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)
                    - In the topbar you can choose to hide:
                        - Page Filter button
                        - Calendar button
                        - Three Dot menu button
                        - Page Width button
                        - Help button
                        - Right Sidebar button
                    - You can select to Hide on Mobile or Hide on All Platforms. This means you can have different settings for different purposes.
                    - For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Hide on Mobile for Help and Hide on All Platforms for Calendar.
                    - TODO:
                        - allow buttons from Roam Depot extensions to be hidden
                - ## [Augmented Headings](https://github.com/mlava/augmented-headings)
                    - Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!
                    - With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot. Note that if you don't change the font settings in Roam Depot settings you won't see any change in the text output even if you make that block a heading. You **must** set font settings to see any difference.
                    - **New:**
                        - added setting to allow user-configured heading tags. If you don't want #h4 you could use #.h4 or even #purple_elephant for that heading tag, and the extension will handle it.
                    - The new headings even work with my Sticky Headings and Table of Contents extension as well!
                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)
                    - For each heading level you can configure:
                        - font size
                        - font weight
                        - font style
                        - font variant
                    - You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.
                    - If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.

                - ## Roam reference expands
                    - show the path of the block reference

                    - # Uninstall
                        - All configurations are stored on the [[roam/reference extends/config]] page and need to be removed manually if you want to uninstall the plugin cleanly.
                - ## Mapbox
                    - Render interactive maps directly in your graph!
                    - ## Usage
                        - Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!
                        - To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.
                        - To start the map at a particular zoom level, create a child block with text "Zoom". Under that block, put in the zoom level value which should be a number. A minimum value of 0 is zoomed all the way out and a maximum value of 18 is zoomed all the way in.
                        - To add Markers to the map, create a child block with text "Markers". Under that block, add one child for every marker you want to include. In the block, write the text you'd like as the label of the block. As a child of **that** block, put the latitude and longitude coordinates of the marker.
                        - For example, the following configuration will have to be set as the child of the block to produce the map below:
                            - Center
                                - 32.715736, -117.161087
                            - Zoom
                                - 12
                            - Markers
                                - David Vargas
                                    - 32.7, -117.2
                                - RoamJS
                                    - 32.72, -117.1
                        - If the Marker text is already a tag in your graph, clicking on the marker pin will take you to that page. Shift clicking the marker will open the tag in the sidebar.
                        - You could also filter the markers that are displayed on your map. Clicking the wrench icon on the top right will open the settings overlay, where you could specify a tag to filter by. All markers that are pages that have a block with the entered tag will remain on the map while the rest get filtered out.

                - ## Oura Ring
                    - Import your Oura Ring daily summaries on a given day into your daily note page!
                    - ## [🔗](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-oura-ring#usage)Usage
                        - You'll first need to add your personal access token associated with your Oura Ring account to the Token field in your Roam Depot Settings. The extension needs this in order to access your personal data. [Click here](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens), to generate your own personal access token.
                        - To import your Oura Ring data to your daily note page, open the Command Palette and enter "Import Oura Ring". If the current page is a Daily note page, it will query the day before the page title, since you usually want to track last night's sleep. Otherwise, it will query yesterday's data by default. It will output the following text:
                        - ```javascript
Bedtime Start:: hh:mm:ss
Bedtime End:: hh:mm:ss
Sleep Duration:: hh:mm:ss
Total Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Total Awake:: hh:mm:ss
Light Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Rem Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Deep Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Day Start:: hh:mm:ss
Day End:: hh:mm:ss
Low Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Medium Activity:: hh:mm:ss
High Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Rest Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Readiness Score:: hh:mm:ss```
                        - You can also import the data by creating a button by typing `{{import oura ring}}` into a page and clicking the button.

        - [[August 18th, 2022]]
            - [[New Features]] __sort of__ #[[Tag Styles]]
                - We decided to include some of the most useful [[roam/css]] [[Tag Styles]] we've developed for ourselves, you may find helpful/inspiring .rm-E  .rm-g  and .rm-hide
                    - ## .rm-E 
                        - Behavior::
                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-E` will display their immediate children next to them, 
                                - rather than indented below them
                        - Use Cases::
                            - When you want a sort of [[Mind Map]] light behavior, 
                                - or just want to view things side by side
                            - 🤷‍♂️ it's nice to have when you want it not much more to it than that
                        - Example::
                            - A #.rm-E 
                                - B
                                    - Note that this only impacts the first level of nesting
                                - C
                                    - If you want to go further, you have to keep using the tag
                                - D [[.rm-E]]
                                    - Using the link, not the tag
                                    - so you can see where it is used
                                    - E [[.rm-E]] 
                                        -  since this class hides itself when used as a tag
                    - ## .rm-g 
                        - Behavior::
                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-g` are hidden when they are open  - revealing the children nested within them 
                                - Children are styled to look like they are one level higher in the block hiearchy than they are -- useful for adding meta-data tags without visually cluttering your outline.
                        - Use Cases::
                            - when you want to group a collection of items and hide the block that contains them
                        - Example::
                            - [[.rm-g]] #[[Fruits]] 
                                - Apples
                                - Pears
                                - Cherries
                    - ## .rm-hide
                        - Use Cases::
                            - When you want to add some info to a block without visually cluttering things up - but still allow the info to be discoverable easily
                        - Behavior::
                            - This block only displays when it is open - when it is closed, it is replaced with a very light bar across it's length
                                - The bar get's darker on hover, and which
                                    - when you click it - it opens the block
                            - In some ways a mirror of .rm-g  
                        - Example::
                            - {{[[DONE]]}} This is a task that I'm hiding the metadata for
                                - Total Time:: 2 min #.rm-hide  
                                    - Start time:: 17:26
                                    - End time:: 17:28  
                            - The block above me ((((jq0MYtn5U)))) has a hidden child - hover between us and click the bar to expand it - or arrow key up from me, or down from it, and you'll see it
                                - Have some hidden children here too
                                - #.rm-hide 
                                    - hidden children
                                - Look between us!
            - [[CSS Changes]]

                - Behavior of [[Inline Calculator]] `{{calc: }}` for parsing block references has changed 
                    - [[Old State]]
                        - Previously, when you composed calculations across many blocks - all of the math text was pulled up and flattened - which could lead to unexpected behavior when building up statements and making calculations that depended on other calculations 
                            - Example::
                                - Wait? 2 times 4 doesn't equal 5! ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FeoLoaSY0y_.png?alt=media&token=0fb80ad2-894a-40b5-ba87-841b7fa3cd63)

                            - The old hack to get around required you to wrap block references in a `( )` to make sure that that each component in the calculation was evaluated independently before the values were aggregated  After this update, every reference used in a calculation will be wrapped in a `()` automatically before calculation is applied remember [[PEMDAS]]?
                                - This is what is actually being evaluated now - if you're using lots of nested refs  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F_0bfRasZfz.png?alt=media&token=edd56c7d-6590-44be-92e3-4b187a50fad2)

            - [[New Features]] #[[Alpha]]
                - `{{embed-path: ((block-ref))}}` - Experimental new view of block embeds where path is visible and clickable - similar to what you'd see for the block in inline-references 
                    - [[Problem it Solves]]
                        - Often when viewing embeds, it is frustrating to not be able to see the context of the embed - the embed-path component lets you see the parent path of the block at a glance, and navigate to it quickly.
            - #[[CSS Changes]]
                - Changed the styling when you zoom out of a block in a context - like sidebar and moved the color into a css variable 
                    - `var(--inline-highlight-color)` for the color of ^^highlights^^
                    - `var(--highlight-color)` for color of highlighted blocks due to zooming out in a embedded context like within backlinks, sidebar, or block refs.

                - Added support for [[Kroki]] diagrams ([Link](https://kroki.io)) #.h
                    - How it works::
                        1. Write your kroki code in a code/regular block, for instance,
                            - ```plain text
graph TD
  A[ Anyone ] -->|Can help | B( Go to github.com/yuzutech/kroki )
  B --> C{ How to contribute? }
  C --> D[ Reporting bugs ]
  C --> E[ Sharing ideas ]
  C --> F[ Advocating ]```
                        2. Then use the following syntax
                            - `{{[[kroki]]: TYPE_HERE: BLOCK_REF_HERE}}`
                                - so for instance, `{{[[kroki]]: mermaid:((13fZ8yxDr))}}` will produce:
                                    - {{[[kroki]]: mermaid:((13fZ8yxDr))}}
