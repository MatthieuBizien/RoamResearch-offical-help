    - [[February 1st, 2023]]
        - [[Roam Extensions]]
            - ## [Self-Destructing Blocks](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-block-self-destruct)
                - Set blocks to self-destruct (be deleted) after a period of time. Every hour the plugin will search for all blocks that reference #[[self-destruct]] (configurable to whatever you would like). Any of those references that are older than the time set will be deleted.
                - A custom deletion time can be set by nesting an attribute below the block that you want deleted.
                - ### [🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-block-self-destruct#use-case-ideas)Use Case Ideas
                    - Blocks left over from daily templates
                    - Using queries on your Daily Notes page or old queries in general.
                    - Keeping your graph lean and clean
                - ### [🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-block-self-destruct#examples)Examples
                    - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-block-self-destruct/raw/main/example.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-block-self-destruct/raw/main/example.png)
            - ## [Hide Topbar Buttons](https://github.com/mlava/hide-topbar-buttons)
                - Reduce unneccessary clutter!
                - This extension allows you to take control of the appearance of your Roam Research topbar. You can choose to show or hide default Roam Research buttons in the topbar.
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)
                - In the topbar you can choose to hide:
                    - Page Filter button
                    - Calendar button
                    - Three Dot menu button
                    - Page Width button
                    - Help button
                    - Right Sidebar button
                - You can select to Hide on Mobile or Hide on All Platforms. This means you can have different settings for different purposes.
                - For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Hide on Mobile for Help and Hide on All Platforms for Calendar.
                - TODO:
                    - allow buttons from Roam Depot extensions to be hidden
            - ## [Augmented Headings](https://github.com/mlava/augmented-headings)
                - Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!
                - With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot. Note that if you don't change the font settings in Roam Depot settings you won't see any change in the text output even if you make that block a heading. You **must** set font settings to see any difference.
                - **New:**
                    - added setting to allow user-configured heading tags. If you don't want #h4 you could use #.h4 or even #purple_elephant for that heading tag, and the extension will handle it.
                - The new headings even work with my Sticky Headings and Table of Contents extension as well!
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)
                - For each heading level you can configure:
                    - font size
                    - font weight
                    - font style
                    - font variant
                - You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.
                - If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.

                - This extension can parse the website title and transform the link to the markdown format when you paste a url into roam block
                - For example, when you paste a link like this `https://developer.roamjs.com/`, this extension is gonna transform it to `[Introduction - RoamJS](https://developer.roamjs.com/)`

        - [[Roam Extensions]]
            - ## Roam reference expands
                - show the path of the block reference
                - ![](https://github.com/dive2Pro/roam-reference-expand/raw/49e028ae09c5ec50eeec4436bd81247b7a7e0685/SCR-20221124-d9c.png)
                - ![](https://github.com/dive2Pro/roam-reference-expand/raw/master/reference%20extends.gif)
                - # Uninstall
                    - All configurations are stored on the [[roam/reference extends/config]] page and need to be removed manually if you want to uninstall the plugin cleanly.
            - ## Mapbox
                - Render interactive maps directly in your graph!
                - ## Usage
                    - Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!
                    - To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.
                    - To start the map at a particular zoom level, create a child block with text "Zoom". Under that block, put in the zoom level value which should be a number. A minimum value of 0 is zoomed all the way out and a maximum value of 18 is zoomed all the way in.
                    - To add Markers to the map, create a child block with text "Markers". Under that block, add one child for every marker you want to include. In the block, write the text you'd like as the label of the block. As a child of **that** block, put the latitude and longitude coordinates of the marker.
                    - For example, the following configuration will have to be set as the child of the block to produce the map below:
                        - Center
                            - 32.715736, -117.161087
                        - Zoom
                            - 12
                        - Markers
                            - David Vargas
                                - 32.7, -117.2
                            - RoamJS
                                - 32.72, -117.1
                    - If the Marker text is already a tag in your graph, clicking on the marker pin will take you to that page. Shift clicking the marker will open the tag in the sidebar.
                    - You could also filter the markers that are displayed on your map. Clicking the wrench icon on the top right will open the settings overlay, where you could specify a tag to filter by. All markers that are pages that have a block with the entered tag will remain on the map while the rest get filtered out.

        - [[Roam Extensions]]
            - ## Oura Ring
                - Import your Oura Ring daily summaries on a given day into your daily note page!
                - ## [🔗](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-oura-ring#usage)Usage
                    - You'll first need to add your personal access token associated with your Oura Ring account to the Token field in your Roam Depot Settings. The extension needs this in order to access your personal data. [Click here](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens), to generate your own personal access token.
                    - To import your Oura Ring data to your daily note page, open the Command Palette and enter "Import Oura Ring". If the current page is a Daily note page, it will query the day before the page title, since you usually want to track last night's sleep. Otherwise, it will query yesterday's data by default. It will output the following text:
                    - ```javascript
Bedtime Start:: hh:mm:ss
Bedtime End:: hh:mm:ss
Sleep Duration:: hh:mm:ss
Total Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Total Awake:: hh:mm:ss
Light Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Rem Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Deep Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Day Start:: hh:mm:ss
Day End:: hh:mm:ss
Low Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Medium Activity:: hh:mm:ss
High Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Rest Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Readiness Score:: hh:mm:ss```
                    - You can also import the data by creating a button by typing `{{import oura ring}}` into a page and clicking the button.

    - [[August 18th, 2022]]
        - [[New Features]] __sort of__ #[[Tag Styles]]
            - We decided to include some of the most useful [[roam/css]] [[Tag Styles]] we've developed for ourselves, you may find helpful/inspiring .rm-E  .rm-g  and .rm-hide
                - ## .rm-E 
                    - Behavior::
                        - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-E` will display their immediate children next to them, 
                            - rather than indented below them
                    - Use Cases::
                        - When you want a sort of [[Mind Map]] light behavior, 
                            - or just want to view things side by side
                        - 🤷‍♂️ it's nice to have when you want it not much more to it than that
                    - Example::
                        - A #.rm-E 
                            - B
                                - Note that this only impacts the first level of nesting
                            - C
                                - If you want to go further, you have to keep using the tag
                            - D [[.rm-E]]
                                - Using the link, not the tag
                                - so you can see where it is used
                                - E [[.rm-E]] 
                                    -  since this class hides itself when used as a tag
                - ## .rm-g 
                    - Behavior::
                        - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-g` are hidden when they are open  - revealing the children nested within them 
                            - Children are styled to look like they are one level higher in the block hiearchy than they are -- useful for adding meta-data tags without visually cluttering your outline.
                    - Use Cases::
                        - when you want to group a collection of items and hide the block that contains them
                    - Example::

                - ## .rm-hide
                    - Use Cases::
                        - When you want to add some info to a block without visually cluttering things up - but still allow the info to be discoverable easily
                    - Behavior::
                        - This block only displays when it is open - when it is closed, it is replaced with a very light bar across it's length
                            - The bar get's darker on hover, and which
                                - when you click it - it opens the block
                        - In some ways a mirror of .rm-g  
                    - Example::
                        - {{[[DONE]]}} This is a task that I'm hiding the metadata for
                            - Total Time:: 2 min #.rm-hide

                                - End time:: 17:28  
                        - The block above me ((((jq0MYtn5U)))) has a hidden child - hover between us and click the bar to expand it - or arrow key up from me, or down from it, and you'll see it
                            - Have some hidden children here too

                                - hidden children
                            - Look between us!
        - [[CSS Changes]]
            - Zooming out from sidebar, embed-path, or backlinks now outlines the block you were originally focused on, rather than coloring the block and all it's children with an obnoxious yellow
                - Example::
                    - Shift click on this reference [[>]] Socrates is Mortal and then click a breadcrumb in the sidebar and

            - Images now display inline (previously the forced a line break)
            - References of blockquotes and Images now display inline
                - Now it is easier to use them for building up compound statements
                    - Example::
                        - [[>]] All Men are Mortal
                        - [[>]] Socrates is a Man
                        - [[>]] Socrates is Mortal

        - [[New Features]]  #[[Improvements]]
            - [[Latex]] now will parse block references, including other latex so you can comp
                - Example::
                    - $$\Large$$\frac{$$n_1$$}{$$n^n$$}$$ + \sum_{i=1}^z $$\mapsto $$n^n$$$$ $$
                        - ### Recursive Latex
                            - $$\frac{$$n_1$$}{$$n^n$$}$$
                                - $$n_1$$
                                - $$n^n$$
                        - ### Plain Text
                            - \sum_{i=1}^z
                                - ^z

                        - ### Reference of Reference - to describe how variable used in another context
                            - $$\mapsto $$n^n$$$$
                                - Here you can describe the meaning of mapsto n^n
                                - $$n^n$$
                                    - Here you could describe the meaning of the n^n that is being described here
                        - ### Sizing
                            - \Large

                                    - \Small
                - Use Cases::
                    - Being able to separately describe each element of the equation.
        - #[[Quality of Life Improvements]] #[[Bug Fixes]] **[[Feature Behavior Change]]**
            - Behavior of [[Inline Calculator]] `{{calc: }}` for parsing block references has changed 
                - [[Old State]]
                    - Previously, when you composed calculations across many blocks - all of the math text was pulled up and flattened - which could lead to unexpected behavior when building up statements and making calculations that depended on other calculations 
                        - Example::
                            - Wait? 2 times 4 doesn't equal 5! ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FeoLoaSY0y_.png?alt=media&token=0fb80ad2-894a-40b5-ba87-841b7fa3cd63)
                                - After Change:: 2 times 4 = 8  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FC500DSjbn0.png?alt=media&token=5ea62b8f-f710-4e59-ba20-b7d4e25c474e)
                        - The old hack to get around required you to wrap block references in a `( )` to make sure that that each component in the calculation was evaluated independently before the values were aggregated  After this update, every reference used in a calculation will be wrapped in a `()` automatically before calculation is applied remember [[PEMDAS]]?
                            - This is what is actually being evaluated now - if you're using lots of nested refs  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F_0bfRasZfz.png?alt=media&token=edd56c7d-6590-44be-92e3-4b187a50fad2)

                        - Example::

                    - New Features::
                        - Clicking the green text of the [[calc]] function has always displayed content of the internals of the calcuation, but now if you click on the = sign after doing this, you can see the fully expanded function which is being evaluated, so you can confirm that everything is happening the way you want it to

    - [[August 15th, 2022]]
        - [[New Features]] #[[Alpha]]
            - `{{embed-path: ((block-ref))}}` - Experimental new view of block embeds where path is visible and clickable - similar to what you'd see for the block in inline-references 
                - [[Problem it Solves]]
                    - Often when viewing embeds, it is frustrating to not be able to see the context of the embed - the embed-path component lets you see the parent path of the block at a glance, and navigate to it quickly.
        - #[[CSS Changes]]
            - Changed the styling when you zoom out of a block in a context - like sidebar and moved the color into a css variable 
                - `var(--inline-highlight-color)` for the color of ^^highlights^^
                - `var(--highlight-color)` for color of highlighted blocks due to zooming out in a embedded context like within backlinks, sidebar, or block refs.

                        - ```plain text
graph TD
  A[ Anyone ] -->|Can help | B( Go to github.com/yuzutech/kroki )
  B --> C{ How to contribute? }
  C --> D[ Reporting bugs ]
  C --> E[ Sharing ideas ]
  C --> F[ Advocating ]```
                    2. Then use the following syntax
                        - `{{[[kroki]]: TYPE_HERE: BLOCK_REF_HERE}}`
                            - so for instance, `{{[[kroki]]: mermaid:((13fZ8yxDr))}}` will produce:
