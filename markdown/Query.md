    - # **Types of queries**
        - ### **and**
            - Find all blocks matching multiple conditions – i.e. blocks or their parents containing multiple page or block references.
            - `{{query: {and: [[page A]] [[page B]] }}}
{{query: {and: [[articles]] ((block)) }}}
{{query: {and: [[Tyler Cowen]] ((block)) [[econ]] }}}
`
        - ### **or**
            - Find all blocks matching any of a number of conditions – i.e. blocks or their parents containing any of the selected page or block references.

            - `{{query: {or: [[page A]] [[page B]] }}}
{{query: {or: [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] }}}
{{query: {or: [[Utah]] [[Idaho]] [[Montana]] }}}
`
        - ### **not**
            - Exclude blocks matching any of the page or block references selected.
            - `{{query: {and: [[page A]] {not: [[page B]] }}}}
{{query: {and: [[Slate Star Codex]] {not: [[psychiatry]] }}}}`
        - ### **between**
            - Finds all blocks on daily pages and blocks mentioning a date between two days. ^^**This only works on Daily Notes page**^^.
            - You can use the following as a shorthand: [[today]], [[tomorrow]], [[yesterday]], [[last week]], [[next week]], [[last month]], and [[next month]]. 
            - `{{query: {between: [[January 1st, 2021]] [[today]] }}
