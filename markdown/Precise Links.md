- Example
    - say I have a collection of statements like these
        - Socrates is a Man
            - certainty:: {{[[slider]]}}
        - Socrates is Mortal
            - certainty:: {{[[slider]]}}
        - All Men are Mortal
            - certainty:: {{[[slider]]}}
    - Then I can reference those statements into a compound statement like this
        - If Socrates is a Man and All Men are Mortal then Socrates is Mortal
            - certainty:: {{[[slider]]}}
            - 
    - I will then see that statement whenever I visit one of the blocks that is referenced within it
        - like this
