- [Project: 30 Demos in 6 Weeks](<Project: 30 Demos in 6 Weeks.md>)
    - [x] [Experiment](<Experiment.md>) - Demo how it was possible to use the combination of [roam/render](<roam/render.md>) and [roam/templates](<roam/templates.md>) to create a **factory template** the creates customizable dropdowns which add block-refs to a selected item from a particular list.

        - To use 
            - [ ] copy this block into your graph #.bp3-card
                - ## Conor's [Factory Template](<Factory Template.md>) for creating Option Dropdowns based on block refences  #[roam/templates](<roam/templates.md>)
                    - Congratulations! You have just created a new **Dropdown Template** 
                        - #.rm-g  #.rm-h 
                            - [ ] Edit the block below to change the template
                                - [RM/Component/Select](<RM/Component/Select.md>) an item from Dropdown List [roam/templates](<roam/templates.md>)
                                    - {{[roam/render](<roam/render.md>): ((pBiRi-Hba)) ((iYpGdGk0B))}}
                            - [ ] Edit these blocks to change the items visible in the dropdown
                                - Dropdown List
                                    - A
                                    - B
                                    - C
                    - [ ] Apply the template #.rm-E 
                        - [ ] type `;;`   
                        - [ ] search for the label you've given it here [->](((ovqdW0R_j))) 
                        -  This will produce a custom Select Component like this one 
                            - {{[roam/render](<roam/render.md>): ((pBiRi-Hba)) ((iYpGdGk0B))}} 
                            - built off this  Dropdown List
                    - This component is an experiment, and was built paritally as a demo of what you can do with  [roam/render](<roam/render.md>) - a feature of roam that allows you to build interactive components out of code blocks written __inside__ your roam graph and referenced by the component in this format `{{[roam/render](<roam/render.md>): ((id for the code block goes here)) }}` 
                        - If you'd like to edit the code for the template - you can edit it [here](((pBiRi-Hba)))
