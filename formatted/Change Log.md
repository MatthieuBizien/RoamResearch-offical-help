            1. ### Alt-click (or opt-click) on a daily note page link to change the date
                - If you're a fellow procrastinator, you can use this to snooze any tasks for a future date! 😅

                    - When you find old/overdue tasks, assign them to today so you do not forget about them
            2. ### Pin/Stick sidebar windows to the top!
                - Long press on the pin button to pin a sidebar window to the top
                - The window will then have a red pin button
                - New windows will appear below the pinned-to-top window

                - __Related change__ to how closing pinned sidebar windows works
                    - Previously they used to come back/resurrect
                    - Now they will not resurrect.
                    - To make sure closing pinned windows does not happen accidentally, a new confirmation dialog has been added

            - ### The New [Roam Append API](<Roam Append API.md>) is out now!
                - This allows you to capture stuff to your unencrypted & **encrypted** graphs!
                - **If you’re not a dev**, 
                    - just know that this opens up a lot of possibilities for capture to your roam graphs.
                        - The [recent improved Speak to Roam apple shortcut](((l-E_9lmp_))) uses this, for example. 
                        - We also have a couple more use-cases/integrations which will be dropping soon!
                            - In particular, a Zapier Integration, which would allow you to do things like:
                                - Automatically save Google Form/typeform responses to a page in your graph
                                - Add Slack saved messages to your graph

        - ### Improved [Speak to Roam Apple Shortcut]([Apple Shortcuts/Speak to Roam](<Apple Shortcuts/Speak to Roam.md>)) with support for encrypted graphs, capture to daily note, and more!! ✨✨
            - Link to install the newest version **v1.3.0**: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ae1ae833cada4999b44d9ac5dda2dc6d
                - Please checkout the [Getting started](<Getting started.md>) guide to get started
            - **Improvements**
                1. We now support both encrypted graphs and unencrypted graphs
                    - On encrypted graphs, you can create an "append-only" token!
                2. Captures to today's Daily Notes Page by default
                    - Captures are stored under a block/capture group `[Speak to Roam](<Speak to Roam.md>) Captures`
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FHju0azD0Rk.png?alt=media&token=0aeb4cfa-8d59-45d0-bc34-e498769a94b1)
                    - If you do not want to capture to DNP, you can alternatively pass an input page to capture underneath!
                3. More resilient to shortcut failure (If shortcut fails, you can find the recordings in Files in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/FailedRecordings`. If it suceeds, you can find them in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/HandledRecordings`. Behavior slightly different on Apple Watch)
                4. Shortcut is now available on the Share Sheet without extra configuration
                    - You can use this to share recordings from the Voice Memos app to Roam via the shortcut!
            - **Requirements**
                - apple devices only (iphone, ipad, mac, apple watch, etc.)
                - Need an OpenAI API key for transcription & optional post-processing.

                - Speak instead of having to type into Roam. 
Additionally, you can speak to a GPT model (providing context to the model from your Roam graph by selecting blocks before calling the command!), or even do translations to English
                - ## Features
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FxtLDz8oskA.png?alt=media&token=7d96b57a-b6dd-45b9-9c3e-da784e4c5a31)
                        - By default, the controls will be inserted in the left sidebar, after "Daily Notes". It's possible to display them in the topbar (always visible, more convenient on mobile).
                    - ### Voice transcription
                        - the transcribed text will be inserted at the bottom of the current page (or page view) or appended to the current focused block.
                        - Uses either an OpenAI API Key (that you need to set up in the extension settings), or if you disable Whisper, uses the free Web Speech API (⚠️ not available in Electron Desktop app and Firefox or Arc browser)
                    - ### Translation
                        - A large number of [source languages are supported](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/supported-languages), but the target language is currently limited to English. This limitation can be easily overcome through post-processing using a GPT model, as it only requires asking it to translate into any language.
                    - ### Speak directly to an AI Assistant (OpenAI GPT models)
                        - ask any question, rephrasing, completion, translation! Feel free to specify the expected format of the response (its length, style, etc.).
                        - assistant response is inserted as last child of prompt block (current limitation: the answer is only one long block)
                        - you can easily **provide context by selecting some block(s)** in the page or right sidebar. You can use it to extend a conversation, ask a question about any content, request a summary or translation, and so on. 🚀
                        - on mobile (selection being not possible), place the cursor in a block to use its content as context, or enable the option to use the whole current view as context (unless you place the cursor in a blank block).
                        - model by default is currently gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
                            - you can try other chat completion model, or your own fine-tuned models
                - ## Quick Start
                    - Install the extension by searching for "Speech to Roam" in Roam Depot
                    - Then, right after installation,
                        - In the settings, provide an OpenAI API key (by copying/pasting an existing key or generating a new key via [this link](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)). You need an account on OpenAI to benefit from Whisper transcriptions.
                - ⚠️ __Currently, this extension doesn't work on either the MacOS desktop app or the Android app, but it works on browsers (desktop and mobile) and on Windows desktop app.__

                - ## Usage
                    - only once: install **Nautilus** and **TODO Trigger** extension
                    - insert the component at the top of your Daily Page using ;;Nautilus template
                    - indent all events and tasks that you want to accomplish below the component as its children
                    - start inserting tasks, then folow up with events
                    - use e.g. "12:30-14:20" or "9 to 10:45" to anchor fixed time events
                    - use e.g. "10m" or "20min" to set the task duration (other than default)
                    - use e.g. "d18:30" or "d9:05" in tasks to denote the time when they were finished (or use extension for it)
                    - during a day: reorder tasks and move some of them after fixed events to ensure they will not be planned earlier

            - Getting Started Guide
                1. Install [Raycast](<Raycast.md>) from https://raycast.com
                2. Then install the Roam Extension from: https://raycast.com/roamresearch/roam-research
                3. Follow the loom video below to add a graph

            - P.S. Users of the older versions of the Raycast extension will need to add their graph(s) again. Sorry for the inconvenience, this should only be a one time thing

            - # [Send To Graph](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph)
                - A Roam Research extension to send blocks from one graph to another. The destination graph does not need to be open. This is a one-way push. The blocks are added to the new graph as if you had created them manually yourself.
                - ## Features
                    - Send blocks to another graph with a simple right-click command or via hotkey.
                    - Configure multiple graphs to send blocks to.
                    - Option to nest sent blocks under a parent block (for example an __[inbox__](<inbox__.md>) tag) in the destination graph.
                - ## Setup
                    - This extension uses the new Roam backend API to allow sending of blocks to graphs that you do not have open. Note: only the creator of a graph can create new API tokens.
                        - In your destination graph go to the Graph Settings page and select New API Token
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-1.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-1.png)
                        - Name the token however you want but make sure to set the Access Scope to Edit Access. This gives the extention edit permissions to the graph.
                            - Note: When sending blocks I __ONLY__ add to the destination graph. There is no code to modify or delete __ANYTHING__.
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-2.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-2.png)
                        - Select Create to generate your unique graph API token. Make sure to save the generated token before navigating away as it is not possible to see the token again once you have navigated away.
                        - Open up the Source Graph and navigate to the Send To Graph settings page.
                        - Add the Graph name and Edit Access token for the destination graph to the settings panel and hit the plus symbol. If either of these is incorrect in any way blocks you attempt to send will not go through. You can add as many graphs as you like.
                            - ![](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-3.png)[🔗](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/raw/main/assets/api-3.png)
                - ## Usage
                    - There are 2 ways of using the Send-To-Graph extension:
                        - Right-click on a block and select "Send to Graph". If you have multiple graphs configured, you will be asked to select the destination graph.
                        - Alternatively, assign a hotkey via the settings panel to send the currently focused block to another graph.
                - ## Example
                    - {{video: https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-send-to-graph/assets/4028391/fee66356-1a15-4432-9b73-52ece2c4d6d9}}

                - A simple Roam Research extension that saves the position of the scrollbar on each page, and when you return to this page, it reverts to the position you last viewed.
                - It just saves the position of the scrollbar in the browser's memory, so when you refresh the browser, the last saved data will be cleared.

            - Changes to `{{video}}` `{{video-timestamp}}` #[Video Timestamps](<Video Timestamps.md>)
                - Video timestamps now include a block reference to the video they belong to
                    - They can be dragged anywhere in Roam, and you can see all of the timestamps of a video from the linked references
                    - Old video timestamps will still work, but they are not auto updated to include the block reference
                - Fixed a bug where timestamps would play a video hidden in the zoom path
                - Inserting a timestamp now automatically adds a space after the timestamp
            - Templates will now apply the state of `{{sliders}}`, `{{excalidraw}}`, `{{diagram}}` and other `{{}}` components

            - [Performance Improvements](<Performance Improvements.md>) and new search feature for [Linked References](<Linked References.md>)
                - Linked references now load lazily, which means it should open __much__ faster than before.
                - The downside is that you can no longer search through them with `cmd-f` or `ctrl-f`, you need to use the built in search component.
                - The new search looks through all of the references, the paths of the references, or the children if the children are open.

                - ### How does it work
                    - Select the Icon Theme. [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/versions/3/[icons](<icons.md>)) is the default for Roam Research. Roam Studio provides [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).
                    - Select the first magic word - this is the name of the tag (e.g., if your tag is [love](<love.md>), your magic word is "love")
                    - Select an icon from the predefined list
                    - Select a color from the predefined list
                    - Select the lightness of the color
                    - **Notes** You can use the same icon for multiple tags - with different colors if you like. An example of this would be a marker for high and critical tasks, which both would use the alert icon, but in yellow for high and red for critical.

                - There have been six editions. This extension for Roam Research provides the ability to draw from any of the first five editions, or a combined list containing all of the prompts from the first five editions. The prompts were sourced from https://github.com/noaoh/oblique-stratagems with thanks.
                - An Oblique Strategy prompt can be obtained using a Command Palette command or Roam Research Hotkey.
                - The following commands are available:

                    - Opening filters is 4-5x faster
                    - Adding or removing a filter is 15-30x faster
                    - Memory usage is a lot less
                    - This is assuming [Linked References](<Linked References.md>) is closed, because displaying all of the references is still very slow
                        - We will be releasing an improvement to linked references to solve this problem soon
                    - Internally we completely rewrote how these work to use the same logic as queries, so that in the future we can add OR filters
                    - The counts for tags changed inside of linked refs filter
                        - The counts now represent how many of the linked references have that tag. When you filter for "includes" a tag, it will show you that many references

                - ## [Sidebar Separators](https://github.com/mlava/sidebar-separators)
                    - Organize your left sidebar shortcuts with separators.
                    - Sometimes you just want some visual separation between your list of shortcuts. This extension allows you to add a horizontal line or blank space between any of your shortcuts, so you can achieve just that.
                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)
                    - In the above image I've inserted a horizontal line after my second shortcut and a blank line after my sixth shortcut.
                    - You can configure each separator in the Roam Depot settings. Use an integer to state where to insert the separator - it will be inserted after that numbered shortcut.
                    - You can have up to three separators, but if there's a need I'll add the option to create more.
                - ## [Roam Depot Format Hotkeys](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-format-hotkeys)
                    - Adds hotkeys for various block formatting options including:
                        - Justify Block (Left, Center, Right, Full)
                        - View As Numbered List
                - ## [Page references counter](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-ref-count)

                        - 🔎 References counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, what is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!
                        - ![ref-count-v1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74436347/218118672-4d7e74aa-e47f-49fb-ac95-7e59e2b1b854.gif)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74436347/218118672-4d7e74aa-e47f-49fb-ac95-7e59e2b1b854.gif)
                        - By default, inline counts are always displayed. As an option, you can make the count appear only on hover over a given page reference. You can toggle separately inline count and search count with dedicated commands in command palette (with customizable hotkeys).

                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)
                    - In the topbar you can choose to hide:
                        - Page Filter button
                        - Calendar button
                        - Three Dot menu button
                        - Page Width button
                        - Help button
                        - Right Sidebar button
                    - You can select to Hide on Mobile or Hide on All Platforms. This means you can have different settings for different purposes.
                    - For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Hide on Mobile for Help and Hide on All Platforms for Calendar.
                    - TODO:
                        - allow buttons from Roam Depot extensions to be hidden
                - ## [Augmented Headings](https://github.com/mlava/augmented-headings)
                    - Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!
                    - With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot. Note that if you don't change the font settings in Roam Depot settings you won't see any change in the text output even if you make that block a heading. You **must** set font settings to see any difference.
                    - **New:**
                        - added setting to allow user-configured heading tags. If you don't want [h4](<h4.md>) you could use #.h4 or even [purple_elephant](<purple_elephant.md>) for that heading tag, and the extension will handle it.
                    - The new headings even work with my Sticky Headings and Table of Contents extension as well!
                    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)
                    - For each heading level you can configure:
                        - font size
                        - font weight
                        - font style
                        - font variant
                    - You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.
                    - If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.

                    - # Uninstall
                        - All configurations are stored on the [roam/reference extends/config](<roam/reference extends/config.md>) page and need to be removed manually if you want to uninstall the plugin cleanly.
                - ## Mapbox
                    - Render interactive maps directly in your graph!
                    - ## Usage
                        - Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!
                        - To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.
                        - To start the map at a particular zoom level, create a child block with text "Zoom". Under that block, put in the zoom level value which should be a number. A minimum value of 0 is zoomed all the way out and a maximum value of 18 is zoomed all the way in.
                        - To add Markers to the map, create a child block with text "Markers". Under that block, add one child for every marker you want to include. In the block, write the text you'd like as the label of the block. As a child of **that** block, put the latitude and longitude coordinates of the marker.
                        - For example, the following configuration will have to be set as the child of the block to produce the map below:
                            - Center
                                - 32.715736, -117.161087
                            - Zoom
                                - 12
                            - Markers
                                - David Vargas
                                    - 32.7, -117.2
                                - RoamJS
                                    - 32.72, -117.1
                        - If the Marker text is already a tag in your graph, clicking on the marker pin will take you to that page. Shift clicking the marker will open the tag in the sidebar.
                        - You could also filter the markers that are displayed on your map. Clicking the wrench icon on the top right will open the settings overlay, where you could specify a tag to filter by. All markers that are pages that have a block with the entered tag will remain on the map while the rest get filtered out.

                - ## Oura Ring
                    - Import your Oura Ring daily summaries on a given day into your daily note page!
                    - ## [🔗](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-oura-ring[usage](<usage.md>))Usage
                        - You'll first need to add your personal access token associated with your Oura Ring account to the Token field in your Roam Depot Settings. The extension needs this in order to access your personal data. [Click here](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens), to generate your own personal access token.
                        - To import your Oura Ring data to your daily note page, open the Command Palette and enter "Import Oura Ring". If the current page is a Daily note page, it will query the day before the page title, since you usually want to track last night's sleep. Otherwise, it will query yesterday's data by default. It will output the following text:
                        - ```javascript
Bedtime Start:: hh:mm:ss
Bedtime End:: hh:mm:ss
Sleep Duration:: hh:mm:ss
Total Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Total Awake:: hh:mm:ss
Light Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Rem Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Deep Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Day Start:: hh:mm:ss
Day End:: hh:mm:ss
Low Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Medium Activity:: hh:mm:ss
High Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Rest Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Readiness Score:: hh:mm:ss```
                        - You can also import the data by creating a button by typing `{{import oura ring}}` into a page and clicking the button.

                        - **[Behavior](<Behavior.md>):**
                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-E` will display their immediate children next to them, 
                                - rather than indented below them

                                - D [.rm-E](<.rm-E.md>)
                                    - Using the link, not the tag
                                    - so you can see where it is used

                                        -  since this class hides itself when used as a tag

                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-g` are hidden when they are open  - revealing the children nested within them 
                                - Children are styled to look like they are one level higher in the block hiearchy than they are -- useful for adding meta-data tags without visually cluttering your outline.

                                - Cherries
                    - ## .rm-hide
                        - **[Use Cases](<Use Cases.md>):**
                            - When you want to add some info to a block without visually cluttering things up - but still allow the info to be discoverable easily
                        - **[Behavior](<Behavior.md>):**
                            - This block only displays when it is open - when it is closed, it is replaced with a very light bar across it's length
                                - The bar get's darker on hover, and which
                                    - when you click it - it opens the block
                            - In some ways a mirror of .rm-g
