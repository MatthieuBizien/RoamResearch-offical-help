    - [August 15th, 2022](<August 15th, 2022.md>)
        - [New Features](<New Features.md>) #[Alpha](<Alpha.md>)
            - `{{embed-path: ((block-ref))}}` - Experimental new view of block embeds where path is visible and clickable - similar to what you'd see for the block in inline-references 
                - [Problem it Solves](<Problem it Solves.md>)
                    - Often when viewing embeds, it is frustrating to not be able to see the context of the embed - the embed-path component lets you see the parent path of the block at a glance, and navigate to it quickly.
        - #[CSS Changes](<CSS Changes.md>)
            - Changed the styling when you zoom out of a block in a context - like sidebar and moved the color into a css variable 
                - `var(--inline-highlight-color)` for the color of ^^highlights^^
                - `var(--highlight-color)` for color of highlighted blocks due to zooming out in a embedded context like within backlinks, sidebar, or block refs.
