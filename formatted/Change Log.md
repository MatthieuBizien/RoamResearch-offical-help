            - # Save Scrollbar Position
                - A simple Roam Research extension that saves the position of the scrollbar on each page, and when you return to this page, it reverts to the position you last viewed.
                - It just saves the position of the scrollbar in the browser's memory, so when you refresh the browser, the last saved data will be cleared.

        - [Quality of Life Improvements](<Quality of Life Improvements.md>)
            - Changes to `{{video}}` `{{video-timestamp}}`
                - Video timestamps now include a block reference to the video they belong to
                    - They can be dragged anywhere in Roam, and you can see all of the timestamps of a video from the linked references
                    - Old video timestamps will still work, but they are not auto updated to include the block reference
                - Fixed a bug where timestamps would play a video hidden in the zoom path
                - Inserting a timestamp now automatically adds a space after the timestamp
            - Templates will now apply the state of `{{sliders}}`, `{{excalidraw}}`, `{{diagram}}` and other `{{}}` components
                - You can also now reference templates inside themselves to track the usage of them
                    - **[Example](<Example.md>):**
                        - [roam](<roam.md>)/templates Daily mood template that tracks itself

    - [June 12th, 2023](<June 12th, 2023.md>)
        - ### [Quality of Life Improvements](<Quality of Life Improvements.md>) ✨
            - [Performance Improvements](<Performance Improvements.md>) and new search feature for [linked references](<linked references.md>)
                - Linked references now load lazily, which means it should open __much__ faster than before.
                - The downside is that you can no longer search through them with `cmd-f` or `ctrl-f`, you need to use the built in search component.
                - The new search looks through all of the references, the paths of the references, or the children if the children are open.
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F58Rma4DQAw.png?alt=media&token=542425e8-6a9d-422e-a06b-dcce8f8c1b61)
        - [Roam Depot Extensions](<Roam Depot Extensions.md>)
            - ## [Magic Tags](https://github.com/rcvd/magic-tags)
                - Magic Tags by [Alexander Rink](<Alexander Rink.md>) transforms tags you specify into beautiful icons while maintaining all functionality, like backlinking and searching.
                - ![Demo of magic tags in action](https://github.com/rcvd/magic-tags/raw/main/screenshots/magic-tags.gif)[🔗](https://github.com/rcvd/magic-tags/raw/main/screenshots/magic-tags.gif)
                - ### How does it work
                    - Select the Icon Theme. [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/versions/3/[icons](<icons.md>)) is the default for Roam Research. Roam Studio provides [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).
                    - Select the first magic word - this is the name of the tag (e.g., if your tag is [love](<love.md>), your magic word is "love")
                    - Select an icon from the predefined list
                    - Select a color from the predefined list
                    - Select the lightness of the color
                    - **Notes** You can use the same icon for multiple tags - with different colors if you like. An example of this would be a marker for high and critical tasks, which both would use the alert icon, but in yellow for high and red for critical.
                    - ![Settings showing tags using the same icon but different colors](https://github.com/rcvd/magic-tags/raw/main/screenshots/high-critical.png)[🔗](https://github.com/rcvd/magic-tags/raw/main/screenshots/high-critical.png)
                - ### Feature Requests, Bugs, and Feedback
                    - If you need an additional icon, have an idea for a new feature, or find a bug, file it under [Issues](https://github.com/rcvd/MagicTags/issues) with a short description and a screenshot.

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies for more information.
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/238811874-8d73b616-2bc1-49c4-89b0-f3755ed1a5a3.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/238811874-8d73b616-2bc1-49c4-89b0-f3755ed1a5a3.png)
                - There have been six editions. This extension for Roam Research provides the ability to draw from any of the first five editions, or a combined list containing all of the prompts from the first five editions. The prompts were sourced from https://github.com/noaoh/oblique-stratagems with thanks.
                - An Oblique Strategy prompt can be obtained using a Command Palette command or Roam Research Hotkey.
                - The following commands are available:
                - Random Oblique Strategy Random Oblique Strategy - 1st Edition Random Oblique Strategy - 2nd Edition Random Oblique Strategy - 3rd Edition Random Oblique Strategy - 4th Edition Random Oblique Strategy - 5th Edition

        - ### [Quality of Life Improvements](<Quality of Life Improvements.md>) ✨
            - [Performance Improvement](<Performance Improvement.md>) to [Filters](<Filters.md>)
                - Opening filters is 4-5x faster
                - Adding or removing a filter is 15-30x faster
                - Memory usage is a lot less
                - This is assuming [Linked References](<Linked References.md>) is closed, because displaying all of the references is still very slow
                    - We will be releasing an improvement to linked references to solve this problem soon
                - Internally we completely rewrote how these work to use the same logic as queries, so that in the future we can add OR filters
                - The counts for tags changed inside of linked refs filter
                    - The counts now represent how many of the linked references have that tag. When you filter for "includes" a tag, it will show you that many references
            - Small [Performance Improvement](<Performance Improvement.md>) to [Unlinked References](<Unlinked References.md>)
            - Small [Performance Improvement](<Performance Improvement.md>) to [Streak](<Streak.md>)
            - [Another](((g3OZJ86Le))) small [Performance Improvement](<Performance Improvement.md>) to [All Pages](<All Pages.md>)
            - Fixed bug that caused versions to be reordered
            - Fixed old daily notes loading on scroll
                - previously it could get stuck and you would have to hover over the new note

                - Search is now 2x faster
                    - Uses 1/3 of the memory of before
            - Fixed double digit numbered lists inside of the `{{search: }}` component

            - Big [Query](<Query.md>) update!
                - Queries are 2 to 10 times faster than before, depending on what you are querying for
                - Queries do not auto update by default now
                    - To rerun the query, click the refresh button on the top right
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FSyeBzzxFj4.png?alt=media&token=dce1c454-ea46-4e82-85a4-e0aeb6c11571)
                        - Closing and re opening the query will also rerun it
                    - We made this change so that Roam doesn't get really slow when you have a query open on the page

                    - You can create a custom component: link-preview with the URL as the argument
                    - {{link-preview https://google.com}}
                        - You can write the currently copied link into Roam using a custom shortcut key

            - ## [Sidebar Separators](https://github.com/mlava/sidebar-separators)
                - Organize your left sidebar shortcuts with separators.
                - Sometimes you just want some visual separation between your list of shortcuts. This extension allows you to add a horizontal line or blank space between any of your shortcuts, so you can achieve just that.
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/219263679-cd1ab703-bc54-49c3-a7a0-a82016b66199.png)
                - In the above image I've inserted a horizontal line after my second shortcut and a blank line after my sixth shortcut.
                - You can configure each separator in the Roam Depot settings. Use an integer to state where to insert the separator - it will be inserted after that numbered shortcut.
                - You can have up to three separators, but if there's a need I'll add the option to create more.
            - ## [Roam Depot Format Hotkeys](https://github.com/8bitgentleman/roam-depot-format-hotkeys)
                - Adds hotkeys for various block formatting options including:
                    - Justify Block (Left, Center, Right, Full)
                    - View As Numbered List

                    - 🔎 References counts are also displayed when you search for a reference, inline or in Quick search, in the autocomplete box, what is particularly useful to identify the actually used pages and the unused or wrong spellings!

                - Reduce unneccessary clutter!
                - This extension allows you to take control of the appearance of your Roam Research topbar. You can choose to show or hide default Roam Research buttons in the topbar.
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/213940140-67f212c2-596f-4771-a92a-e5519136a80a.png)
                - In the topbar you can choose to hide:
                    - Page Filter button
                    - Calendar button
                    - Three Dot menu button
                    - Page Width button
                    - Help button
                    - Right Sidebar button
                - You can select to Hide on Mobile or Hide on All Platforms. This means you can have different settings for different purposes.
                - For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Hide on Mobile for Help and Hide on All Platforms for Calendar.
                - TODO:
                    - allow buttons from Roam Depot extensions to be hidden
            - ## [Augmented Headings](https://github.com/mlava/augmented-headings)
                - Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!
                - With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot. Note that if you don't change the font settings in Roam Depot settings you won't see any change in the text output even if you make that block a heading. You **must** set font settings to see any difference.
                - **New:**
                    - added setting to allow user-configured heading tags. If you don't want [h4](<h4.md>) you could use #.h4 or even [purple_elephant](<purple_elephant.md>) for that heading tag, and the extension will handle it.
                - The new headings even work with my Sticky Headings and Table of Contents extension as well!
                - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)[🔗](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/214956832-d2711867-ab73-4af0-9e29-074eaf0b3ac8.png)
                - For each heading level you can configure:
                    - font size
                    - font weight
                    - font style
                    - font variant
                - You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.
                - If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.

                - # Uninstall
                    - All configurations are stored on the [roam/reference extends/config](<roam/reference extends/config.md>) page and need to be removed manually if you want to uninstall the plugin cleanly.
            - ## Mapbox
                - Render interactive maps directly in your graph!
                - ## Usage
                    - Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!
                    - To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.
                    - To start the map at a particular zoom level, create a child block with text "Zoom". Under that block, put in the zoom level value which should be a number. A minimum value of 0 is zoomed all the way out and a maximum value of 18 is zoomed all the way in.
                    - To add Markers to the map, create a child block with text "Markers". Under that block, add one child for every marker you want to include. In the block, write the text you'd like as the label of the block. As a child of **that** block, put the latitude and longitude coordinates of the marker.
                    - For example, the following configuration will have to be set as the child of the block to produce the map below:
                        - Center
                            - 32.715736, -117.161087
                        - Zoom
                            - 12
                        - Markers
                            - David Vargas
                                - 32.7, -117.2
                            - RoamJS
                                - 32.72, -117.1
                    - If the Marker text is already a tag in your graph, clicking on the marker pin will take you to that page. Shift clicking the marker will open the tag in the sidebar.
                    - You could also filter the markers that are displayed on your map. Clicking the wrench icon on the top right will open the settings overlay, where you could specify a tag to filter by. All markers that are pages that have a block with the entered tag will remain on the map while the rest get filtered out.

            - ## Oura Ring
                - Import your Oura Ring daily summaries on a given day into your daily note page!
                - ## [🔗](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-oura-ring[usage](<usage.md>))Usage
                    - You'll first need to add your personal access token associated with your Oura Ring account to the Token field in your Roam Depot Settings. The extension needs this in order to access your personal data. [Click here](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens), to generate your own personal access token.
                    - To import your Oura Ring data to your daily note page, open the Command Palette and enter "Import Oura Ring". If the current page is a Daily note page, it will query the day before the page title, since you usually want to track last night's sleep. Otherwise, it will query yesterday's data by default. It will output the following text:
                    - ```javascript
Bedtime Start:: hh:mm:ss
Bedtime End:: hh:mm:ss
Sleep Duration:: hh:mm:ss
Total Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Total Awake:: hh:mm:ss
Light Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Rem Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Deep Sleep:: hh:mm:ss
Day Start:: hh:mm:ss
Day End:: hh:mm:ss
Low Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Medium Activity:: hh:mm:ss
High Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Rest Activity:: hh:mm:ss
Readiness Score:: hh:mm:ss```
                    - You can also import the data by creating a button by typing `{{import oura ring}}` into a page and clicking the button.

                - We decided to include some of the most useful [roam/css](<roam/css.md>) [Tag Styles](<Tag Styles.md>) we've developed for ourselves, you may find helpful/inspiring .rm-E  .rm-g  and .rm-hide
                    - ## .rm-E 
                        - **[Behavior](<Behavior.md>):**
                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-E` will display their immediate children next to them, 
                                - rather than indented below them
                        - **[Use Cases](<Use Cases.md>):**
                            - When you want a sort of [Mind Map](<Mind Map.md>) light behavior, 
                                - or just want to view things side by side
                            - 🤷‍♂️ it's nice to have when you want it not much more to it than that
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**
                            - A #.rm-E 
                                - B
                                    - Note that this only impacts the first level of nesting
                                - C
                                    - If you want to go further, you have to keep using the tag
                                - D [.rm-E](<.rm-E.md>)
                                    - Using the link, not the tag
                                    - so you can see where it is used
                                    - E [.rm-E](<.rm-E.md>) 
                                        -  since this class hides itself when used as a tag
                    - ## .rm-g 
                        - **[Behavior](<Behavior.md>):**
                            - Blocks tagged with `#.rm-g` are hidden when they are open  - revealing the children nested within them 
                                - Children are styled to look like they are one level higher in the block hiearchy than they are -- useful for adding meta-data tags without visually cluttering your outline.
                        - **[Use Cases](<Use Cases.md>):**
                            - when you want to group a collection of items and hide the block that contains them

                                - Cherries
                    - ## .rm-hide
                        - **[Use Cases](<Use Cases.md>):**
                            - When you want to add some info to a block without visually cluttering things up - but still allow the info to be discoverable easily
                        - **[Behavior](<Behavior.md>):**
                            - This block only displays when it is open - when it is closed, it is replaced with a very light bar across it's length
                                - The bar get's darker on hover, and which
                                    - when you click it - it opens the block
                            - In some ways a mirror of .rm-g  
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**
                            - [x] This is a task that I'm hiding the metadata for

                                    - **[End time](<End time.md>):** 17:28  
                            - The block above me ((((jq0MYtn5U)))) has a hidden child - hover between us and click the bar to expand it - or arrow key up from me, or down from it, and you'll see it
                                - Have some hidden children here too
                                - #.rm-hide 
                                    - hidden children
                                - Look between us!
            - [CSS Changes](<CSS Changes.md>)
                - Zooming out from sidebar, embed-path, or backlinks now outlines the block you were originally focused on, rather than coloring the block and all it's children with an obnoxious yellow

                        1. Write your kroki code in a code/regular block, for instance,

graph TD
  A[ Anyone ] -->|Can help | B( Go to github.com/yuzutech/kroki )
  B --> C{ How to contribute? }
  C --> D[ Reporting bugs ]
  C --> E[ Sharing ideas ]
  C --> F[ Advocating ]```
                        2. Then use the following syntax
                            - `{{[kroki](<kroki.md>): TYPE_HERE: BLOCK_REF_HERE}}`
