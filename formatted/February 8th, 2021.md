    - [ ] Given a map, or a [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) database at two points in time
    - [ ] Generate a diff of the two structures
    - [ ] Generate the minimal transaction which will bring A -> B, and vice versa.
    - [Bonus](<Bonus.md>) 
        - [ ] Given a set of User-Events which map to certain transactions - find the sequence of user events which brought A -> B, or which would bring B -> A
        - [ ] Take a roam outline tree, and create a datascript DB with just the data contained within it  - such as this one This item
        - [ ] Publish your code and the demo on a roam graph using `roam/render` and custom components
            - Roam allows you to write arbitrary CLJS code - and evaluate it in your graph - you can use this code - and the roam Alpha API to query your graph, and create mutations for it.
            - Submit your answer as a roam-graph
            - All code should be in the same Roam Graph as the working demo.

        - ## IF you want to also be considered for  #[UI Engineer](<UI Engineer.md>)
            - [ ] generate a UI for displaying the diff 
            - [ ] create a simple component that will let you save the state of a block subtree at various points, and return to these states - by firing new transactions
