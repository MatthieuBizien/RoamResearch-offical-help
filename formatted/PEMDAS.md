- The old hack to get around required you to wrap block references in a `( )` to make sure that that each component in the calculation was evaluated independently before the values were aggregated  After this update, every reference used in a calculation will be wrapped in a `()` automatically before calculation is applied remember [PEMDAS](<PEMDAS.md>)?
