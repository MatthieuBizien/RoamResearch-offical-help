        - By "augmenting human intellect" [rm-col-span-1](<rm-col-span-1.md>)
            - we mean 
                - increasing the capability #.contents
                    - of a man #.contents
                        - to approach a complex problem situation, 
                        - xyz
                    - to gain  in:
                        - #.contents comprehension
                            -  to suit his particular needs, 
                            - and to derive solutions to problems. 
                    - Increased capability in this respect
                    -  is taken to mean a mixture of the following: 
                        - #.rm-g
                            - more-rapid comprehension, 
                            - better comprehension, 
                            - the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, 
                            - speedier solutions, 
                            - better solutions, 
                            - and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble.
