- [About Roam's product](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct)
    - Thanks to my correspondents on Twitter, I think I'm starting to figure out [Roam's](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=roam+research&t=h_&ia=web) product. I am guessing about some of these things, using the blogger's ethos, put your mistakes out there for everyone to see so you can learn faster. :-) [#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a144717](<../a144717.md>))
        - In Roam's world an outline is computed, not stored. There is no [OPML](http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html) file for an outline, as with my outliners. There is a database with blocks of text, and they are connected to other nodes/blocks through links that are represented textually by double-square brackets or with a hashtag as in Twitter. [#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a144730](<../a144730.md>))
        - In Roam, the outline hierarchy is a way of browsing the results of a query. I've often thought of this as an interesting way of doing things, and even have an experiment up that I think is Roam-like, [thesaurus.land](http://thesaurus.land/?word=roam). It's a way of navigating a database of synonyms, using an outline structure as the presentation format. It works.[#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a144814](<../a144814.md>))
        - Can you reorganize an outline in Roam? I haven't heard about anyone doing that. This is one of the reasons I'm not sure Roam actually is an outliner. In my world, an outliner has two defining functions: 1. You have control of detail, via expand and collapse and 2. You can reorganize according to structure. The text is on rails. [#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a150030](<../a150030.md>))
        - People expect by entering all their ideas into Roam's database that there will eventually be serendipities, things they will learn by seeing connections they had not seen before. [#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a144915](<../a144915.md>))
        - You are expected to use Roam for all your note-taking. Many people see Roam as a replacement for Evernote. [#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a151314](<../a151314.md>))
        - In my world, OPML support is not incidental. Each of my outliners is a church, but the religion is OPML. There is no lock-in in this world. You can use any other tool that can read or write OPML. So when I ask if Roam supports OPML, I'm asking if their product can play with products that are compatible with mine. This is like asking, imho, if a news reader can deal with RSS. With OPML the standard is rock solid. For some reason no one has screwed with it (thankful).[#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a150634](<../a150634.md>))
        - Can I use my own editing tools to get my ideas into their database? I don't know. I suspect a developer could create a bridge. Most of my writing is available in OPML. There are lots of examples in the [repository](https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog) that holds my blog content starting in May 2017. The rest of it is on the web, and I can provide a zip archive for a developer who wants to try importing all 26-plus years of my blog. ;-)[#](http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct[a145529](<../a145529.md>))
