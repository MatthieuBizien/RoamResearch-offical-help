- Diagrams are an extra dimension of the blocks in your graph. You can lay your thoughts out in a 2D infinite canvas, group and connect ideas. Every node (or group) in the diagram corresponds to a block in your graph. Any blocks used in a diagram will show up in references section for that block.

        - **Introspect.** If you don’t
know what you want, your
wants will be decided for
you, by people and forces
who don’t have your best
interests at heart.
        - **Beware assholes.** Learn to
identify assholes, and to lead
people in coordinating
effectively to diminish the
costs of their actions.
        - **Develop your taste.** Taste is the most
precious and important thing in the world.
People with great taste create a
disproportionate amount of value in the
world, but the world we live in
disincentivizes the development of taste.
        - **Do not dehumanize
people**. People are
people. Do not demonize
or pedestalize them.
        - **Be honest
about what
you don’t
know.**
        - **Be kind.**
        - **Own your shit and fix
it.** You will never be
perfect, but you can
always be better than
you were yesterday.
        - Aggressively seek
out agreements,
particularly with
outgroup.
        - everything is connected
        - **Be more sensitive.** In
every sense. It helps
with everything.
        - If you don’t decide,
you’re letting
somebody else
decide.
        - Real progress
happens at the
bottlenecks.
        - The public is insufficiently
educated on how to be a good
public.
        - **Confront your fears headon.** Most fears are outdated,
obsolete, and can be
dismantled with a little work
        - **Find out how you are
fucked up.** “They fuck you
up your mom and dad, they
don’t mean to but they do…”
You inherited all sorts of
bullshit that you don’t even
know.
        - **Appreciate
incentives.**
        - **Recognize that
your mental
models are
flawed.** Everybody
inherits a flawed,
imperfect system.
        - everything is a remix,
so don’t worry about
being “original”
        - Everything is vague to a
degree you do not
realize until you attempt
to make it precise.
        - **Have stuff to look
forward to.** You can’t
engineer happiness,
but you sure can
engineer excitement.
        - **Learn project
management.**
Everything is a
project.
        - **The main thing
holding you back
is the way that
you’re thinking.**
        - **Have fun. **You were born
crying. You should die
laughing.
        - **Take notes.** Keeping a journal of your
own thoughts, ideas and beliefs over
time will teach you things about yourself
you cannot learn any other way.
        - **It’s not about you.**
        - **Prioritize.**
There’s an
infinite set of
things to do.
What’s the
most important
thing? Do that.
        - **Do not be afraid of
being sad or wrong.**
        - the point of strength
is to nourish others.
        - **Strategize**. You have
limited time and limited
resources.
        - **Continue.** Life will kick
your ass. Dont’ give up,
don’t give in. Get up and
try again.
        - **Be so prolific you don’t
recognize yourself.** This is
the most effective way to
develop your ability to gratify
your own taste.
        - **Be Economically Useful.**
The world is not kind to
those who cannot create
value in the marketplace.
        - **Seek to learn &
understand
everything.** It can
never be done, but
it’s always worth
trying.
        - **Make Friends.** It is
dangerous to go alone.
You heal yourself by
helping others. Be kind
and serve others. We can
do more together than we
can do alone.
        - **One must imagine Sisyphus
LOL-ing.** Existence is absurd, and
laughter is the only reasonable
response to an absurd universe.
        - **Articulate your
assumptions and
question them.** If you
identify a bad one, you
can get rid of it and have
a marginally better life,
instantly
        - the tool should
fit the user
        - Narcissists ruin
self-love for the
rest of us.
        - **Fiddle with it.**
Mess around.
It’s the most
natural way of
learning
things.
        - all advice is context dependent to a
degree most do not realize until
they encounter a different context
        - **We all want to be loved.**
        - **Indulge your curiosity.**
Following your nose will lead
you to interesting places, and
in the process you will become
an interesting person.
        - safe spaces are for
nurturing, not coddling.
        - **Ask clarifying questions.**
