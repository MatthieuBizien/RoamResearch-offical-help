- Diagrams are an extra dimension of the blocks in your graph. You can lay your thoughts out in a 2D infinite canvas, group and connect ideas. Every node (or group) in the diagram corresponds to a block in your graph. Any blocks used in a diagram will show up in references section for that block.

        - just try to do something amazing
        - Make things YOU want
        - Your best job → distinctiveness
        - Who have surprising insights
        - Don't worry about "style"
        - "If at first you don't succeed: either try again, or backtrack and try again
        - Learn fundamentals
        - Natural aptitude
        - doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible

    - {{diagram:@visakan's Memex}}
        - **Introspect.** If you don’t
          know what you want, your
          wants will be decided for
          you, by people and forces
          who don’t have your best
          interests at heart.
        - **Beware assholes.** Learn to
          identify assholes, and to lead
          people in coordinating
          effectively to diminish the
          costs of their actions.
        - **Develop your taste.** Taste is the most
          precious and important thing in the world.
          People with great taste create a
          disproportionate amount of value in the
          world, but the world we live in
          disincentivizes the development of taste.
        - **Do not dehumanize
          people**. People are
          people. Do not demonize
          or pedestalize them.
        - **Be honest
          about what
          you don’t
          know.**
        - **Be kind.**
        - **Own your shit and fix
          it.** You will never be
          perfect, but you can
          always be better than
          you were yesterday.
        - Aggressively seek
          out agreements,
          particularly with
          outgroup.
        - everything is connected
        - **Be more sensitive.** In
          every sense. It helps
          with everything.
        - If you don’t decide,
          you’re letting
          somebody else
          decide.
        - Real progress
          happens at the
          bottlenecks.
        - The public is insufficiently
          educated on how to be a good
          public.
        - **Confront your fears headon.** Most fears are outdated,
          obsolete, and can be
          dismantled with a little work
        - **Find out how you are
          fucked up.** “They fuck you
          up your mom and dad, they
          don’t mean to but they do…”
          You inherited all sorts of
          bullshit that you don’t even
          know.
        - **Appreciate
          incentives.**
        - **Recognize that
          your mental
          models are
          flawed.** Everybody
          inherits a flawed,
          imperfect system.
        - everything is a remix,
          so don’t worry about
          being “original”
        - Everything is vague to a
          degree you do not
          realize until you attempt
          to make it precise.
        - **Have stuff to look
          forward to.** You can’t
          engineer happiness,
          but you sure can
          engineer excitement.
        - **Learn project
          management.**
          Everything is a
          project.
        - **The main thing
          holding you back
          is the way that
          you’re thinking.**
        - **Have fun. **You were born
          crying. You should die
          laughing.
        - **Take notes.** Keeping a journal of your
          own thoughts, ideas and beliefs over
          time will teach you things about yourself
          you cannot learn any other way.
        - **It’s not about you.**
        - **Prioritize.**
          There’s an
          infinite set of
          things to do.
          What’s the
          most important
          thing? Do that.
        - **Do not be afraid of
          being sad or wrong.**
        - the point of strength
          is to nourish others.
        - **Strategize**. You have
          limited time and limited
          resources.
        - **Continue.** Life will kick
          your ass. Dont’ give up,
          don’t give in. Get up and
          try again.
        - **Be so prolific you don’t
          recognize yourself.** This is
          the most effective way to
          develop your ability to gratify
          your own taste.
        - **Be Economically Useful.**
          The world is not kind to
          those who cannot create
          value in the marketplace.
        - **Seek to learn &
          understand
          everything.** It can
          never be done, but
          it’s always worth
          trying.
        - **Make Friends.** It is
          dangerous to go alone.
          You heal yourself by
          helping others. Be kind
          and serve others. We can
          do more together than we
          can do alone.
        - **One must imagine Sisyphus
          LOL-ing.** Existence is absurd, and
          laughter is the only reasonable
          response to an absurd universe.
        - **Articulate your
          assumptions and
          question them.** If you
          identify a bad one, you
          can get rid of it and have
          a marginally better life,
          instantly
        - the tool should
          fit the user
        - Narcissists ruin
          self-love for the
          rest of us.
        - **Fiddle with it.**
          Mess around.
          It’s the most
          natural way of
          learning
          things.
        - all advice is context dependent to a
          degree most do not realize until
          they encounter a different context
        - **We all want to be loved.**
        - **Indulge your curiosity.**
          Following your nose will lead
          you to interesting places, and
          in the process you will become
          an interesting person.
        - safe spaces are for
          nurturing, not coddling.
        - **Ask clarifying questions.**
