    - Changes from 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0
        - 1. We now support both encrypted graphs and unencrypted graphs
        - 2. If no Page title passed in, captures to Daily Notes Page for today by default
        - 3. More resilient to shortcut failure (If shortcut fails, you can find the recordings in Files in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/FailedRecordings`. If it suceeds, you can find them in `Shortcuts/SpeakToRoam/HandledRecordings`. Behavior slightly different on Apple Watch)
