        3. After clicking the button, please enter a clear description of expected usage. In the access scope, select **read & edit access** for unencrypted graphs and **append-only access** for encrypted graphs. More regarding scope below
            - More details regarding scopes for API tokens below:
                - **read-only access**
                    - (only available for unencrypted graphs)
                    - This scope only allows access to read to your graph.
                    - In the case of the Zapier integration, this means that you can only use the "Trigger"s, but not the "Action"s
                - **read & edit access**
                    - (only available for unencrypted graphs)
                    - this scope is the most permissive one. It allows the service to both read your graph and edit/add stuff to it. 
                    - In the case of the Zapier integration, this means that you can use both the "Trigger"s and the "Action"s
                - **append-only access**
                    - (available for **both** encrypted & unencrypted graphs)
                    - this access only provides the service ability to __add__ stuff to your graph
                    - In the case of the Zapier integration, this means that you can only use the "Actions"s, but not the "Trigger"s
        4. In the next screen, click on the "Clipboard" icon ðŸ“‹ to copy the token to your clipboard. It will start with "roam-graph-token-"
