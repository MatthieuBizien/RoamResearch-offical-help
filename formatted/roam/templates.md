    - An Engineering Problem Solving Process
        - ^^An engineered, systematic approach to problem solving can be invaluable in solving problems, capturing knowledge, and discovering solutions.^^ An approach that I suggest involves starting with a simple outline consisting of the following sections (as appropriate - sometimes it makes sense to combine or eliminate certain sections). Feel free to delete this paragraph as you fill out the template.
        - **[Problem Statement](<../Problem Statement.md>):** This should be a simple 1-2 sentence (no more!) statement of the problem. Do not describe symptoms. To the best of your ability, reduce the problem to its bare essence here. Over time this statement may be refined. A key principle is that ^^if you cannot state your problem concisely, you probably don't know what it is and you almost certainly cannot communicate it effectively to others^^.
        - **[Description](<../Description.md>):** Here you provide a detailed description of the problem. 
            - Describe why you want to solve this problem (if you do) and what, if anything, makes this problem particularly hard. This can be particularly valuable if you are considering writing new code. Sometimes after further evaluation you will realize it is better to use an alternative or take no action at present.
            - Sometimes it is worth capturing the ideas but saving the solution for another time.
        - **[Given](<../Given.md>):** List all things that have been provided to you, including facts, stories, etc.
        - **[Required](<../Required.md>):** State all of the requirements to be met to provide a solution to the problem.
            - Functional/User (Required): These are the things that a user must be able to do to solve the problem. They may be stated as user stories such as "As a user, I can do X so that Y." If you do not state who can do what and why, then the requirement is suspect.
            - Nonfunctional/Technical: Technical requirements often revolve around criteria such as scaling, cost, operations, etc. I often recommend a different page for technical requirements as it is easy for problem solvers (especially developers) to move towards a technical solution (a form) prior to actually understanding the problem to be solved (the function).[1](((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function)))
        - **[Knowns](<../Knowns.md>):** State all the things you know about the problem. Provide links, references, citations, etc. as needed to trace the lineage of each known item.
        - **[Unknowns](<../Unknowns.md>):** What don't you know about the problem. Here you will try to anticipate the questions that you need to answer to better understand the problem.
            - Alternative presentations of knowns and unknowns could include a Johari Window[2](((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window))) or a "Rumsfeld-esque"[3](((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns))) categorization.

                        - Unknown
        - **[Assumptions](<../Assumptions.md>):** What do you believe to be true regarding this problem?
        - **[Alternatives](<../Alternatives.md>):** What alternatives already exist to this problem? What do you do now to solve the problem? What happens if you do nothing? If this is a technical solution, can an existing solution be used?
        - **[Solution](<../Solution.md>):** Based on all of the previous information, provide the solution to the problem. This could be a technical solution, process, new product, etc. Note that if multiple solutions are provided (suppose you provide multiple product offerings to solve the same problem) it is perfectly appropriate to have subpages for each solution.
        - **[Recommendations](<../Recommendations.md>):** An alternative to (or something to be used in conjunction with) a solution is one or more recommendations. Again, if appropriate recommendations can merit their own subpages.
