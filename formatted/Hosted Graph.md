- What does it mean?
    - If it's a private graph (you're the only person accessing it)
        - You are able to access your Roam graph anywhere with its URL once you're logged into your account 
    - If it's shared with selected individuals
        - The shared accounts can either read or edit your graph, when they log into Roam and open your graph's URL
        - See [Sharing](<Sharing.md>) for more info
    - If it's publicly available
        - Anyone can see your graph via its URL
        - See [Sharing](<Sharing.md>) for more info
