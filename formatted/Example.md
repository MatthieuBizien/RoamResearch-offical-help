        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

## [Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
- Fixed templates which internally referenced the first block in the template had broken references when applying the template
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- like [embed](<embed.md>), but it only displays the children of the block
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- You can also now reference templates inside themselves to track the usage of them
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- Fixed double digit numbered lists inside of the `{{search: }}` component

                    - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- Previously, when you composed calculations across many blocks - all of the math text was pulled up and flattened - which could lead to unexpected behavior when building up statements and making calculations that depended on other calculations 
                            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- After this update, every reference used in a calculation will be wrapped in a `()` automatically before calculation is applied
