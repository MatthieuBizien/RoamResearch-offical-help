## [Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
- Fixed the screen jump that happens when clicking into a block in the [mobile](<mobile.md>) app
                - **[Requires](<Requires.md>):**

- for example, in some devices, it would float way up and then slowly float down. In others, it would get obscured. The behavior should be much better now across the board
                - **[Requires](<Requires.md>):**
