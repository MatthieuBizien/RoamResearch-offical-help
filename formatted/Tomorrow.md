- The "tomorrow" function auto generates tomorrow's daily notes page, it will either give you a static result, or a variable result ("tomorrow" will always point to tomorrow's date, rather than a set date) when used in a [Query](<Query.md>) 
    - For example, a static result: tomorrow is [March 9th, 2021](<March 9th, 2021.md>)
    - A variable result: {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [today](<today.md>) [tomorrow](<tomorrow.md>) {not: [query](<query.md>)}}}}
